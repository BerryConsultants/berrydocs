## Study Info

The Study Info sub-tab provides parameters for specifying:

- Study Information, selecting: whether there are control arms in each
  group as well as a treatment arm or only a treatment arm, whether an
  event represents patient improvement or deterioration, whether the
  trial is attempting to show the treatment’s superiority over the
  control, or its non-inferiority to it, and the length of time subjects
  are to be followed.

- Design Options, selecting: whether the design is adaptive and there
  are to be interims where the trial can be modified or not, and whether
  the design will look at subject’s longitudinal results at interim
  visits before their final visit.

- Groups, defining the different groups to be studied.

![The Study Info sub-tab.](../EDTTE/media/image15.png){#fig-fig15}

- In ‘Study Information’ the following is specified:

  - Whether there are control arms in each group as well as a treatment
    arm or only a treatment arm (the analysis is to “Compare to an
    objective control”).

    - If control arms are included the analysis will be by the
      comparison of the results of the subjects on the treatment arm
      with that of the subjects on the control arm.

    - If an objective control is used, there will be no control arm in
      the trial and the analysis will be by the comparison of the
      results of the subjects on the treatment arm with an assumed
      ‘historic’ or ‘objective’ control response.

  - Whether an event is subject improvement or subject deterioration.
    This determines the direction of the comparisons performed when
    making decisions about the trial’s success or futility.

    - If an event indicates success (subject improvement), then success
      criteria will estimate the probability that the hazard ratio of
      the treatment arm to the control arm (or of a specified event rate
      based on historical data) is greater than 1 by some Target Hazard
      Ratio Difference for Success (THRDS) (also called the Clinically Significant               Difference (CSD)). Futility criteria will
      estimate the probability that the hazard ratio of the treatment
      arm to the control is greater than 1 by more than the Target
      Hazard Ratio Difference for Futility (THRDF).

    - If an event indicates failure (subject condition worsening), then
      success criteria will estimate the probability that the hazard
      ratio of the treatment arm to the control arm (or of a specified
      event rate based on historical data) to be less than 1 by some
      Target Hazard Ratio Difference for Success (TRDS). Futility
      criteria will estimate the probability that the hazard ratio of
      the treatment arm to the control is less than 1, by the Target
      Hazard Ratio Difference for Futility (THRDF).

    - See @sec-groups for more information.

  - Whether the aim of the study is to determine superiority or
    non-inferiority. If non-inferiority is specified, then on other
    tabs, instead of specifying a clinically significant difference
    (CSD), a non-inferiority margin is specified. Whereas in a
    superiority trial the target is to be ‘better’ than control by the
    specified margin, in a non-inferiority trial the target is to be not
    worse than control by the specified margin.

  - The limit on subject follow up, this can be either:

    - The maximum follow-up time, no subject will be followed for longer
      than this. If the study does not stop early it will stop when
      every subject recruited has reached their maximum follow-up time
      or has had an event.

    - The follow-up time after full enrolment. If the study does not
      stop early then it will stop the specified time after full
      enrolment or when every subject has had an event.

- Note that as a result of being able to specify whether a higher or
  lower event rate represents improvement, and whether the aim is
  superiority or non-inferiority, the CSD or the Margin will almost
  always be a positive value. The user may specify clinically
  significant differences, the engine will automatically determine which
  direction is appropriate (e.g. if lower values are subject
  improvement, the engine will realize a THRD of 0.3 for success
  corresponds to a hazard ratio of 0.7”)

- In ‘Design Options’ the following is specified, where the simpler
  options are taken, this allows the GUI to reduce the number of options
  presented to the user.

  - Specify an Adaptive or Non-Adaptive design. If ‘Enable adaptive
    features’ is selected the ’Design \> Interims’ and ‘Design
    Success/Futility Criteria \> Interims tabs are now visible having
    not been required for non-adaptive designs.

    ![Defining Groups.](../EDTTE/media/image16.png){#fig-fig16}

- Groups:

  - Groups can be added and deleted (clicking ‘Delete’ deletes the
    currently selected group).

  - Groups can be named and it is possible to specify whether there is a
    ‘cap’ on the number of subjects that can be recruited into that
    group, if so then the maximum ‘Group size’ must be specified.

  - If any groups do not have an individual group cap, then an overall
    cap (max sample size) must be specified. If all groups have a cap it
    is still possible to specify an overall cap (which to have any
    meaning, must be less than the sum of the individual group caps).

## Group Info {#sec-groups}

On this tab values to define the analysis for each group are specified.

In a trial to show superiority, for each group the Target Clinically
Significant Difference can be set. Optionally the parameters for a phase
3 may be specified to allow the predictive probability of subsequent
success in such a phase 3 trial to be used as decision criteria.

- With a time-to-event endpoint the Clinically Significant Difference is
  in terms of Target Hazard Ratio Difference – that is a difference from
  1 in the ratio of the hazard rate in the treatment arm and the hazard
  rate in the control arm. Separate differences can be set for
  determining success and futility, and separate differences can be set
  for each group and for the across groups analysis. Their use in
  practice is specified on the “Design \> Stopping Criteria” and “Design
  \> Evaluation Criteria” tabs.

- The phase 3 success criteria are:

  - Phase 3 total number of subjects per arm

  - The required one-sided alpha

  - Whether the phase 3 is to use a test for superiority or
    non-inferiority (set independently from whether the ED trial is for
    superiority or non-inferiority)

  - A super-superiority margin / non-inferiority margin (depending on
    whether the phase 3 trial is for superiority or non-inferiority),
    this margin is independent from any margins specified for the ED
    trial.

- Given these criteria FACTS calculates the predicted probability of
  success in the subsequent phase 3, given the estimate of the hazard
  ratio integrated over the uncertainty in that estimate. The
  conventional expected power of the specified phase 3 is calculated for
  the treatment effect in each MCMC sample and then averaged. The
  resulting predicted probability of success in phase 3 can then be used
  in the stopping criteria and final evaluation criteria.

![The Group Info sub-tab.](../EDTTE/media/image17.png){#fig-fig17}

Separate ‘Target Hazard Ratio Differences’ can be set for success and
for futility, specifying the THRD for success and THRD for futility. We
use the terms Target Hazard Rate Difference here as it makes it clearer
that the value to be entered should be positive. Elsewhere (in column
headings for instance) the more conventional term CSD may be used.

- If used to decide to stop a group for success or judge whether the
  group was successful in the final evaluation, the criteria will test
  whether $PR(1 - HR > CSHRD\ for\ success) > Success\ threshold\ $.

  That is, whether the posterior probability that the hazard ratio is
  less than one by more than the target hazard ratio difference is
  greater than a specified threshold (which is set on the Design tabs).

- If used to decide to stop a group for futility or judge whether the
  group was futile in the final evaluation, the criteria will test
  whether $\Pr(1 - HR > CSHRD\ for\ futility) < Futility\ threshold$

  That is, whether he posterior probability that the hazard ratio is
  less than one by more than the target hazard ratio difference for
  futility is less than a specified threshold (which is set on the
  Design tabs).

- If the endpoint is such that an event means subject improvement, then
  the comparison is reversed (the treatment difference becomes
  $HR - 1$ and if the trial is non-inferiority then the test for
  “being greater than the CSD” is replaced with testing for “being less
  than the NIM” (Non-Inferiority Margin). Thus the meaning of the user
  specified Difference or Margin is interpreted taking into account both
  whether a response means ‘better’ or ‘worse’ and whether the trial aim
  is ‘superiority’ or ‘non-inferiority’. The result is that for normal
  usage the value entered will be +ve, as the following diagrams should
  make clear:
  
  ![](../EDCont/media/image94.png){#fig-fig94}

Note that in Superiority trials the required THRD for success will be
greater than or equal to the THRD for futility, whereas in the
Non-Inferiority trials the required NIM for futility will be greater
than or equal to the NIM for success.

### Notes on setting Target Hazard Ratio Differences

Target Hazard Ratio Differences (THRD) are also referred to as
Clinically Significant Differences (CSD). A “standard” hypothesis test
for demonstrating superiority to control uses a CSD of 0. Testing with a
non-zero CSD is different, and the implications need to be carefully
understood.

The first mistake to avoid is setting the target hazard ratio difference
for success too large. The decisions for success are in terms of the
estimated posterior probability that the difference of the hazard ratio
from 1 is greater than the target. If the CSD is set to what might be
the treatment difference in the “alternate hypothesis” of a standard
hypothesis test, we could only expect on average to have a posterior
probability that the treatment difference is greater than the CSD of
50%.

To achieve posterior probabilities of \> 50%, the observed difference
must be greater than the target difference. To achieve the desired power
by lowering the required posterior probability would be a mistake, as
posterior probability thresholds of \< 50% have the undesirable
characteristic that the criteria can be met in circumstances where it
can be seen that if further data was gathered consistent with what had
been seen already, it would lead the threshold no longer being met. The
posterior distribution would shrink so that there was no longer
sufficient of the tail above the CSD.

It is better therefore to use a target hazard ratio difference for
success that, should the treatment have the value that it is hoped to
achieve, we would expect to see some \>50% probability of being greater
than it. Thus rather than using what might be termed ‘the target value’
for the THRDS, it is better to use ‘the minimum acceptable value’.

The same target difference can be used to decide futility, requiring a
\<\< 50% confidence that the difference of the hazard ratio from 1 is
greater than the target difference. However, particularly if there are
other endpoints not being explored in the simulation, or other
properties of the treatment (such as convenience, compliance, cost,
tolerability etc.) that might justify continued development even if it
is not an outright winner on the primary endpoint, it may be that a
lower target hazard ration difference needs to be set as the threshold
for determining futility – for example sufficient to demonstrate that
development even on the basis of non-inferiority on the primary endpoint
is likely to fail. Hence FACTS allows separate CSDs to be set for
assessing success and futility.

### Non-inferiority

In a trial to show non-inferiority, the tab is the same except that
‘Target Hazard Ratio Differences’ are now ‘Margin deltas’ to be set.

![Group Info tab, in a non-inferiority design.](../EDTTE/media/image18.png){#fig-fig18}

## Visits

If events are observed at any time that they occur during follow up,
then there is no need to specify a visit schedule, the length of follow
up will be as it has been specified on the Study \> Study Info tab
(above), leave the “Events Are Only Observed at Visits” check
box unchecked:

![Events Observed When They Occur.](../EDTTE/media/image19.png){#fig-fig19}

If observation of event is to be only at visits, the visit schedule
needs to be specified. There is an additional observation at the end of
follow-up. Visits can be specified one at a time, by entering the
required week value for the visit and then clicking ‘Add’, or by
specifying a regularly spaced sequence: select ‘Auto-Generate’, enter
the number of visits, the week of the first visit and the number of
weeks between each visit and then click ‘Generate’.

Individual visits can be deleted by selecting them in the list and
clicking ‘Delete’. The default visit names can be edited by clicking the
visit name and typing. The week and the index cannot be changed. Should
it be necessary to change the week of a visit, the incorrect visit must
be deleted and a new one with the correct week number added.

![Observation of Events Restricted to Visits.](../EDTTE/media/image20.png){#fig-fig20}

## Variants

On this tab the user can specify that a number of design variants should
be created. Currently the only design feature that can be changed is the
sample size (maximum number of subjects).

If “multiple variants” is checked then the user can specify that
simulations setups should be created for each simulation scenario with
versions of the design with a different maximum number of subjects.

The user enters the number of variants they wish to create. Then in the
resulting table, enter different maximum subjects for each group that
has had a cap specified on the Study \> Study Info tab and maximum
“Total Subjects” for each variant. On the simulations tab FACTS will
then create a copy of all the scenarios to run with each variant.

In FACTS Enrichment Designs, as well as trial Success and Failure rates,
a major Operating Characteristic that we often wish to estimate is the
ability of the design (if the trial is successful) to select the ‘right’
groups, depending of course on the scenario being simulated. To enable
FACTS to report this the user must specify on the Virtual Subject
Response \> Explicitly Defined \> Group Response profiles which of the
groups “Should succeed”, that is, it would constitute a ‘correct
selection’ by the design in that scenario.
