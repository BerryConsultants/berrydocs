## Study Info

The Study Info sub-tab provides parameters for specifying:

- Study Information, selecting: whether there are control arms in each
  group as well as a treatment arm or only a treatment arm, whether a
  higher or lower response represents patient improvement and whether
  the trial attempting to show the treatment’s superiority over the
  control, or its non-inferiority to it.

- Design Options, selecting: whether the design is adaptive and there
  are to be interims where the trial can be modified or not, and whether
  the design will look at subject’s longitudinal results at interim
  visits before their final visit.

- Groups, defining the different groups to be studied.

![The Study Info sub-tab](../EDCont/media/image15.png){#fig-fig15}

- In ‘Study Information’ the following is specified:

  - Whether there are control arms in each group as well as a treatment
    arm or only a treatment arm (the analysis is to “Compare to an
    objective control”).

    - If control arms are included, the analysis will be by the
      comparison of the results of the subjects on the treatment arm
      with that of the subjects on the control arm.

    - If an objective control is used, there will be no control arm in
      the trial and the analysis will be by the comparison of the
      results of the subjects on the treatment arm with an assumed
      ‘historic’ or ‘objective’ control response.

  - Whether higher response or lower response is subject improvement.
    This determines the direction of the comparisons performed when
    making decisions about the trial’s success or futility.

    - If a higher response is subject improvement, then success criteria
      will look for the mean change from baseline of subjects in the
      treatment arm to be greater than that of the subjects in the
      control arm (or of a specified mean change based on historical
      data), or greater than control by some Target mean difference for
      success (The Clinically Significant Difference, CSD, for
      success).

    - If a lower response is subject improvement, then success criteria
      will look for the mean change from baseline of subjects in the
      treatment arm to be less than that of the subjects in the control
      arm (or of a specified mean change based on historical data), or
      less than control by some Target Mean Difference for Futility (The
      CSD for futility).

    - See @sec-group-info for more information

  - Whether the aim of the study is to determine superiority or
    non-inferiority. If non-inferiority is specified, then on other
    tabs, instead of specifying a clinically significant difference, a
    non-inferiority margin is specified. Whereas in a superiority trial
    the target is to be ‘better’ than control by the specified margin,
    in a non-inferiority trial the target is to be “not worse than”
    control by the specified margin.

- Note that as a result of being able to specify whether a higher or
  lower response represents improvement, and whether the aim is
  superiority or non-inferiority, the CSDs or the NI Margins will almost
  always be positive values. FACTS will automatically determine which
  direction is appropriate (e.g. if lower values are subject
  improvement, the engine will realize a CSD of 10 for success
  corresponds to lowering the mean by 10”)

- In ‘Design Options’ the following is specified, where the simpler
  options are taken, this allows the GUI to reduce the number of options
  presented to the user.

  - Specify an Adaptive or Non-Adaptive design. If ‘Enable adaptive
    features’ is selected the ’Design \> Interims’ and ‘Design
    Success/Futility Criteria \> Interims tabs are now visible having
    not been required for non-adaptive designs.

  - Specify whether the design will use ‘Longitudinal modelling’ or not.
    If longitudinal modelling is not selected then the ‘Virtual Subject
    Response \> Longitudinal’ and ‘Design \> Longitudinal’ tabs are
    hidden as they are not required.

  - To ‘Include baseline data’ or not. If baseline is included then
    additional options are enabled to model subjects’ baselines and
    their possible interaction with response. If baseline is included
    response may be:

    - Change from baseline

    - Final endpoint value

    Note that this setting changes both how responses are simulated *and*
    how they are modelled, so for most purposes this choice of response
    merely changes how things are labelled. The exceptions are ITP and
    Baseline Carried Forward where the choice of ‘change from baseline’ or
    ‘final endpoint value’ does affect behavior.

![The Group Info sub-tab](../EDCont/media/image16.png){#fig-fig16}

- Groups:

  - Groups can be added and deleted (clicking ‘Delete’ deletes the
    currently selected group).

  - The groups’ names edited to something meaningful for the trial and
    it is possible to specify whether there is a ‘cap’ on the number of
    subjects that can be recruited into that group, if so then the
    ‘Group size’ must be specified.

  - If any groups do not have an individual group cap, then an overall
    study cap (max sample size) must be specified. If all groups have a
    cap it is still possible to specify an overall study cap (which to
    have any effect, must be less than the sum of the individual group
    caps).

## Group Info {#sec-group-info}

On this tab values that govern the analysis for each group are
specified.

### Trials to show Superiority {#sec-study-superiority}

In a trial to show superiority, for each group the Target mean
difference for success and Target mean difference for futility may be
specified, these are referred to as the CSDs (Clinically Significant
Differences). Optionally the parameters for a phase 3 may be to allow
the predictive probability of subsequent success in such a phase 3 trial
to be used as decision criteria.

- With a continuous endpoint the Clinically Significant Difference is in
  terms of Target Mean Difference – that is a difference between the
  mean change from baseline in the treatment arm and the mean changed
  from baseline in the control arm. Separate differences can be set for
  determining success and futility, and separate differences can be set
  for each group and for the across groups analysis. Their use in
  practice is specified on the “Design \> Stopping Criteria” and “Design
  \> Evaluation Criteria” tabs.

![The Group Info sub-tab](../EDCont/media/image17.png){#fig-fig17}

- The phase 3 criteria are:

  - Phase 3 total number of subjects per arm

  - The required one-sided alpha

  - Whether the phase 3 is to use a test for superiority or
    non-inferiority (set independently from whether the ED trial is for
    superiority or non-inferiority)

  - A super-superiority margin / non-inferiority margin (depending on
    whether the phase 3 trial is for superiority or non-inferiority),
    this margin is independent from any margins specified for the ED
    trial.

- Given these criteria FACTS calculates the predicted probability of
  success in such a trial for each treatment arm given the estimate of
  the treatment difference, integrated over the uncertainty in that
  estimate. The conventional expected power of the specified phase 3 is
  calculated for the treatment effect in each MCMC sample and then
  averaged. The resulting predicted probability of success in phase 3
  can then be used in the stopping criteria and final evaluation
  criteria.

Separate ‘Target Mean Differences’ can be set, specifying the TMD for
success and TMD for futility. We use the terms Target Mean Difference
here, as it makes it clearer that the value to be entered should be
positive. Elsewhere (in column headings for instance) the more
conventional term CSD is used.

- If the “Posterior probability” criteria is used for stopping a group
  for success or judging if a group is successful in the final
  evaluation, the criteria will test whether
  $\Pr\left( \theta_{d} - \theta_{0} > CSD\ for\ success \right) > Success\ threshold$

  That is whether the posterior probability that the mean treatment
  difference is greater than the target mean difference for success is
  greater than a specified threshold (set on the Design tabs).

- If the “Posterior probability” criteria is used for stopping a group
  for futility or judging if a group is futile in the final evaluation,
  the criteria will test whether
  $\Pr\left( \theta_{d} - \theta_{0} > CSD\ for\ futility \right) < Futility\ threshold$

  That is whether the posterior probability that the mean treatment
  difference is greater than the target mean difference for futility by
  is less than a specified threshold (set on the Design tabs).

- If the endpoint is such that a *lower* response means improvement,
  then the comparison is reversed (becomes $\theta_{0} - \theta_{d}$)
  and if the trial is non-inferiority then the test for “being greater
  than the CSD” is replaced with testing for “being less than the NIM”
  (Non-Inferiority Margin). Thus the meaning of the user specified
  Difference or Margin is interpreted taking into account both whether a
  higher response means ‘better’ or ‘worse’ and whether the trial aim is
  ‘superiority’ or ‘non-inferiority’. The result is that for normal
  usage the value entered will be +ve, as the following diagrams should
  make clear:
  
  ![](../EDCont/media/image94.png){#fig-fig94}

Note that in Superiority trials the required TMD for success will be
greater than or equal to the TMD for futility, whereas in the
Non-Inferiority trials the required NIM for futility will be greater
than or equal to the NIM for success.

### Notes on setting Target Mean Differences

A “standard” hypothesis test for demonstrating superiority to control
uses an effective TMD, or CSD, of 0. Testing with a non-zero CSD is
different, and the implications need to be carefully understood.

The first mistake to avoid is setting the target mean difference for
success too large. The decisions for success are in terms of the
estimated posterior probability that the mean difference between the
response on the treatment arm and the response on the control arm is
greater than the target. If the CSD is set to what might be the
treatment difference in the “alternate hypothesis” in standard
hypothesis test, we could only expect on average to have a posterior
probability that the treatment difference is greater than the CSD of
50%.

To achieve posterior probabilities of \> 50%, we must set a CSD that we
expect the treatment to exceed. To achieve the desired power by instead
lowering the required posterior probability threshold would be a
mistake, as posterior probability thresholds of \< 50% have the
undesirable characteristic that the criteria can be met in circumstances
where it can be seen that if further data was gathered consistent with
what had been seen already, it would lead the threshold no longer being
met. The posterior distribution would shrink so that there was no longer
sufficient of the tail above the CSD.

It is better therefore to use a target mean difference for success that,
should the treatment have the value that it is hoped to achieve, we
would expect to see some \>50% probability of being greater than it.
Thus rather than using what might be termed ‘the target value’ for the
CSD, it is better to use ‘the minimum acceptable value’.

The same target difference can be used to decide futility, requiring a
\<\< 50% confidence that the mean difference of the response on the
treatment arm from response on the control arm is greater than the
target. However, particularly if there are other endpoints not being
explored in the simulation, or other properties of the treatment (such
as convenience, compliance, cost, tolerability etc.) that might justify
continued development even if it is not an outright winner on the
primary endpoint, it may be that a lower target mean difference needs to
be set as the threshold for determining futility – for example
sufficient to demonstrate that development even on the basis of
non-inferiority on the primary endpoint is likely to fail. Hence FACTS
allows separate CSDs to be set for assessing success and futility.

### Trials to show Non-inferiority

In a trial to show non-inferiority, the tab is the same except that
‘Target Mean Differences’ are now ‘Target Non-inferiority Margins’.

![Group Info tab, in a non-inferiority design](../EDCont/media/image18.png){#fig-fig18}

As with trials to show Superiority, optionally the phase 3 criteria can
be set (see @sec-study-superiority).

## Visits

If longitudinal modeling is not being used, then simply the time to the
final visit is specified:

![Time to endpoint](../EDCont/media/image19.png){#fig-fig19}

Otherwise the visit schedule needs to be specified. The last visit in
the schedule is taken to be when the final endpoint is observed. Visits
can be specified one at a time by entering the week of the visit and
then clicking ‘Add’, or by specifying a regularly spaced sequence:
select ‘Auto-Generate’, enter the number of visits, the week of the
first visit and the number of weeks between each visit and then click
‘Generate’.

Individual visits can be deleted by selecting them in the list and
clicking ‘Delete’. The default visit names can be edited by clicking the
visit name and typing. The week of the visit and the visit index cannot
be changed. Should it be necessary to change the week of a visit, the
incorrect visit must be deleted and a new one with the correct week
number added.

![Visit schedule](../EDCont/media/image20.png){#fig-fig20}

## Variants

On this tab the user can specify that a number of design variants should
be created. Currently the only design feature that can be changed is the
sample size (maximum number of subjects).

If “multiple variants” is checked then the user can specify that
simulations setups should be created for each simulation scenario with
versions of the design with a different maximum number of subjects.

The user enters the number of variants they wish to create. Then in the
resulting table, enter different maximum subjects for each group that
has had a cap specified on the Study \> Study Info tab and maximum
“Total Subjects” for each variant. On the simulations tab FACTS will
then create a copy of all the scenarios to run with each variant.

In FACTS Enrichment Designs, as well as trial Success and Failure rates,
a major Operating Characteristic that we often wish to estimate is the
ability of the design (if the trial is successful) to select the ‘right’
groups, depending of course on the scenario being simulated. To enable
FACTS to report this the user must specify on the Virtual Subject
Response \> Explicitly Defined \> Group Response profiles which of the
groups “Should succeed”, that is, it would constitute a ‘correct
selection’ by the design in that scenario.
