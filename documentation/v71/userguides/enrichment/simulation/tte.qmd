# Output Files

FACTS stores the results of simulations as ‘.csv’ files under a Results
folder. For each row in the simulations table, there is a folder named
by the profiles that make up the scenario, which contains the
corresponding ‘.csv’ files. Right-clicking on the row displays a context
menu which includes the option to open explore in the corresponding
folder.

![](../EDTTE/media/image84.png){#fig-fig84tte}


These files can be opened using Microsoft Excel, but versions of Excel
before 2007 are restricted to 256 columns, which is too few to view some
files in their entirety. The ‘Calc’ application in ‘OpenOffice’ will
show all the columns (and will open two files that have the same name at
the same time!). Because Excel takes out a file lock on any file it has
open, while a file is open in Excel it cannot be deleted or modified by
another application. The most common cause for an error to be reported
when simulating trials in FACTS is because the user has one of the
previous results files is still open in Excel.

In the scenario directory there are the following types of results file:

**Summary.csv** Contains a single row of data that summarizes the
simulation results. This is the source of the shown on the simulations
tab.

**Summary_freq.csv** Contains a single row of data that that summarizes
the frequentist analysis of the simulations.

**Simulations.csv** Contains one row per simulation describing the final
state of each simulation for every trial simulated.

**Simulations_freq.csv** Contains one row per simulation describing the
frequentist analysis of the final state of each simulation for every
trial simulated.

**MCMCNNNNN.csv** Contains one row per MCMC sample, where NNNNN is the
number of the simulation. By default this file is written out only for
the first simulation, but this can be changed vai the “MCMC Setting”
button on the simulaitons tab.

**PatientsNNNNN.csv** Contains one row per patient in simulation, where
NNNNN is the number of the simulation. By default this file is written
out only for the first simulation, but this can be changed via the
simulations tab.

**WeeksNNNNN.csv** Contains one row for each interim during a simulation
where NNN is the number of the simulation. By default this file is
written only for the first 100 simulations, but this can be changed via
the advanced button on the simulation tab. The values in the last row of
the “weeks” file will be the same as the final values for that
simulation in the simulations file.

**Weeks_freqNNNNN.csv** Contains one row for each interim during a
simulation where NNN is the number of the simulation. By default this
file is written only for the first simulation, but this can be changed
via the advanced button on the simulation tab.

the simulation are included. The first two columns are the analysis
index and the sample (within analysis) index. The remaining columns are
the parameters whose sample values are being reported, the number and
constituents of these columns are highly variable depending on design of
the statistical analysis.

| Column Title | Number of columns | Description |
|------|----|-------------------|
| Analysis | 1 | The index of the analysis (interim) in the simulation |
| Sample | 1 | The index of the sample within the analysis |
| HR | G | The estimate of the Hazard Ratio in each group |
| Overall HR | 1 | The estimate of the overall Hazard Ratio |
| Lambda \<group\> \<seg\> | G \* S | The estimate of the event rate in the control arm in each of the Hazard Model observation segments in each group |
| Overall Lambda \<group\> | G | The estimate over all the observation segments of the event rate in the control arm in each group. |
