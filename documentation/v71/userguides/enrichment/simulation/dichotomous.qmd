# Output Files

FACTS stores the results of simulations as ‘.csv’ files under a Results
folder. For each row in the simulations table, there is a folder named
by the profiles that make up the scenario, which contains the
corresponding ‘.csv’ files. Right-clicking on the row displays a context
menu, which includes the option to open, explore in the corresponding
folder.

![](../EDDich/media/image87.png){#fig-fig87dich}

These files can be opened using Microsoft Excel, but versions of Excel
before 2007 are restricted to 256 columns, which is too few to view some
files in their entirety. The ‘Calc’ application in ‘OpenOffice’ will
show all the columns (and will open two files that have the same name at
the same time!). Because Excel takes out a file lock on any file it has
open, while a file is open in Excel it cannot be deleted or modified by
another application. The most common cause for an error to be reported
when simulating trials in FACTS is because the user has one of the
previous results files is still open in Excel.

In the scenario directory there are the following types of results file:

**Summary.csv** Contains a single row of data that summarizes the
simulation results. This is the source of the shown on the simulations
tab.

**Summary_freq_bocf.csv**

**Summary_freq_fail.csv**

**Summary_freq_ignore.csv**

**Summary_freq_locf.csv** Contains a single row of data that that
summarizes the frequentist analysis of the simulations. A file is output
for each of the different methods for dealing with missing data that are
applicable: BOCF if the baseline score is being simulated (Continuous
Only), LOCF and “ignore” (referred to as PP (Per-Protocol) in the GUI)
and Fail (Dichotomous only).

**Simulations.csv** Contains one row per simulation describing the final
state of each simulation for every trial simulated.

**Simulations_freq_bocf.csv**

**Simulations_freq_fail.csv**

**Simulations_freq_ignore.csv**

**Simulations_freq_locf.csv** Contains one row per simulation describing
the frequentist analysis of the final state of each simulation for every
trial simulated. A file is output for each of the different methods for
dealing with missing data that are applicable: BOCF if the baseline
score is being simulated (Continuous only), LOCF and “ignore” (referred
to as PP (Per-Protocol) in the GUI) and Fail (Dichotomous only).

**PatientsNNNNN.csv** Contains one row per patient in simulation, where
NNNNN is the number of the simulation. By default this file is written
out only for the first simulation, but this can be changed via the
‘Advanced’ button on the simulations tab.

**WeeksNNNNN.csv** Contains one row for each interim during a simulation
where NNN is the number of the simulation. By default this file is
written only for the first 100 simulations, but this can be changed via
the simulation tab. The values in the last row of the “weeks” file will
be the same as the final values for that simulation in the simulations
file.

**weeks_freq_bocf_NNNNN.csv,**

**weeks_freq_fail_NNNN.csv,**

**weeks_freq_ignore_NNNN.csv,**

**weeks_freq_locf_NNNNN.csv,**

Contains one row for each interim during a simulation where NNNNN is the
number of the simulation. A file is output for each simulation for which
a frequentist “weeks file” is to be output, and for each of the
different methods for dealing with missing data that are applicable:
BOCF if the baseline score is being simulated (Continuous Only), LOCF
and “ignore” (referred to as PP (Per-Protocol) in the GUI) and Fail
(Dichotomous only)

does not contain columns for the ‘final’ values of the evaluation
criteria.

## Contents of PatientsNNNNN.csv

| Column Title | Number of columns | Description |
|------|----|-------------------|
| \#Subject | 1 | The subject id number, starting at 1. |
| Region | 1 | Region index |
| DateInWeeks | 1 | The date, in weeks from the start of the trial, of the subject’s baseline visit and randomization. |
| Group | 1 | The index number of the group the subject belongs to. |
| Arm | 1 | A flag indicating the arm the subject was randomized to: 0 = Control, 1 = Study Treatment. |
| LastVisit# | 1 | The index of the last visit for which subject data is available |
| Visit \<visit\> | V | The subject’s endpoint score for that visit: -9999 = not available. |

## Contents of MCMCNNNNN.csv

The MCMC file if requested for output by the user, contains all the MCMC
samples for the fitted parameters in the design. There is one row per
sample (including the burnin) and the samples from all the analyses in
the simulation are included. The first two columns are the analysis
index and the sample (within analysis) index. The remaining columns are
the parameters whose sample values are being reported, the number and
constituents of these columns are highly variable depending on design of
the statistical analysis.

### Content if using a conventional Dichotomous endpoint

| Column Title | Number of columns | Description |
|------|----|-------------------|
| Analysis | 1 | The index of the analysis (interim) in the simulation |
| Sample | 1 | The index of the sample within the analysis |
| Pi1 \<group\> | G | The estimate of the response rate on the treatment arm in each group |
| OverallTheta | 1 | The overall treatment difference in log-odds |
| Pi0 \<group\> | G | The estimate of the response rate on the control arm in each group. |
| OverallGamma \<group\> | G | The log odds of the response rate on control in each group |
|  |  | Longitudinal parameters – the number and names of the longitudinal parameters will depend on which longitudinal model is being used in the analysis (if any) and how many model instances are being used. The reported parameter names can be matched up against the symbols used on the Design \> Longitudinal Model tab |
