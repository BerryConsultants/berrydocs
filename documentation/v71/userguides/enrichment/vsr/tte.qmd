# Virtual Subject Response

The Virtual Subject Response tab allows the user to explicitly define
virtual subject response profiles, and/or to import virtual subject
response from externally simulated PK/PD data. When simulations are
executed, they will be executed for each profile specified by the user.

## Explicitly Defined

Unlike other endpoints where simply a response (mean change from base
line or rate) is specified, specification of subject responses for a
time-to-event endpoint is by separately specifying a piecewise
exponential event rate for the control population and then hazard ratios
for the treatment arms. For simplicity and consistency, this means of
specifying the simulated event rates is also used when no control arm is
present and the comparison is with historic control rates.

### Control Hazard Rates

Control hazard rate profiles may be added, deleted, and renamed using
the table and corresponding buttons on the left hand side of the screen
in @fig-fig22. Event rates values are entered for control
subjects in each group. By specifying segment breakpoints (in weeks)
different event rates for different periods of follow-up can be
specified. The graphical representation of these values updates
accordingly.

To remove an unwanted segment breakpoint, select the row where the
segment starts with that breakpoint and click on ‘Delete’. Note that
segments are always defined in weeks. The selection of the unit time
only applies to the specification of the event rate on this page.

### Group Response

Response profiles may be added, deleted, and renamed using the table and
corresponding buttons on the left hand side of the screen in @fig-fig23.
Hazard ratios are entered for the study treatment arm for each group
directly into the Hazard ratio column of the table. The graphical
representation of these values updates accordingly.

In addition it is possible for the user to specify if a group “Should
Succeed” using the “Should succeed” checkbox on each row. This is then
used in the summary of the simulation results to compute how often the
simulated trial was successful and groups that ‘Should Succeed’ were
successful (reported in the column “Ppn Correct Groups”) and how often
the simulated trial was successful and groups that were not marked
‘Should Succeed’ were successful (reported in the column “Ppn Incorrect
Groups”).

This graph that shows the response to simulate that has been specified –
as with all graphs in the application – may be easily copied using the
‘Copy Graph’ option in the context menu accessed by right-clicking on
the graph. The user is given the option to copy the graph to their
clipboard (for easy pasting into other applications, such as Microsoft
Word or PowerPoint), or to save the graph as an image file.

### Load Scenario Response From File

If the “Load scenario means from a file” option is selected then in
scenarios using this profile the simulations will use a range of dose
responses.

Each individual simulation uses one set of responses from the supplied
file, each row being used in an equal number of simulations. The summary
results are thus averaged over all the VSRs in the file. The use of this
form of simulation is somewhat different from simulations using a single
rate or single external virtual subject response file. When all the
simulations are simulated from a single version of the ‘truth’ then the
purpose of the simulations is to analyse the performance of the design
under that specific circumstance. When the simulations are based on a
range of ‘truths’ loaded from an ‘.mvsr’ file then the summary results
show the expected probability of the different outcomes for the trial
over that range of possible circumstances. Note that to give different
VSRs different weights of expectation, the more likely VSRs should be
repeated within the file.

For TTE the user must supply 2 files – one for the Control Hazard Rates
and one for the Hazard Ratios in each group. MVSR hazard rates are only
combined with MVSR control hazard rates. MVSR hazard rates are only
combined with MVSR control hazard rates. The lines from each file are
paired up for each simulation, so the first control hazard rate is used
with the first group response hazard ratio, the second control hazard
rate is used with the second dose response hazard ratio and so on. There
must be the same number of lines in each file.

![Virtual Subject Response - Loading scenario hazard rates from a MVSR file](../EDTTE/media/image24.png){#fig-fig24}

After selecting the “.mvsr” file the graph shows the individual control
hazard rates for each group.

![Virtual Subject response – Loading group response using an MVSR file](../EDTTE/media/image25.png){#fig-fig25}

After selecting the “.mvsr” file the graph shows the individual hazard
ratios for each group.

The format of the file is a simple CSV text file. Lines starting with a
‘#’ character are ignored so the file can include comment and header
lines. The VSR parameters are provided in two separate files, (the
number of lines in the files must be the same for the two files). The
formats are:

- The Control Hazard Rate File: Each line should contain columns
  \[L<sub>1,1</sub>, L<sub>1,2</sub>, … , L<sub>1,S</sub>,
  L<sub>2,1</sub>, L<sub>2,2</sub>, … , L<sub>2,S</sub>, …
  L<sub>G,1</sub>, L<sub>G,2</sub>, … , L<sub>G,S</sub>\] giving the
  true control hazard rates (lambda) for each of the S segments for each
  of the G groups. (Note: FACTS assumes that the unit of time is weeks)

- The Hazard Ratio File: Each line should contain columns
  \[HR<sub>1</sub>, HR<sub>2</sub>, … , HR<sub>G</sub>\] giving the true
  treatment arm Mean Hazard Ratios for each of the G groups.

For example:

```
# TTE control hazard rates, 8 groups 1 segment
# Same number of rows as in Group Response MVSR file
#G1

## External

As well as simulating subject response within FACTS they can be
simulated externally, from a PK-PD model for instance, and imported into
FACTS where the supplied responses are sampled from when simulating the
trial. The specification of a file containing subject response data
(which must be in the required format) can be done from the External
Files sub-tab depicted below.

To import an external file, the user must first add a profile to the
table. After adding the profile a file selector window is opened and the
user must select the file of externally simulated data. To change the
selection, click the ‘Browse’ button .

![External Data](../EDTTE/media/image26.png){#fig-fig26}

### Required Format of Externally Simulated Detail

The supplied data should be in the following format: an ascii file with
data in comma separated value format with the following columns:

1.  Patient id

2.  Group index (1, 2, 3,… )

3.  Arm Index (1 = Control, 2 = Treatment)

4.  Uncensored time to event in weeks

The GUI requires that the file name has a “.dat” suffix.

The following shows values from an example file. Unlike other endpoints
there is only one line per subject, as there is no need to record the
subject’s state at interim visits.

```
#Patient ID, Group Index, Arm Index, Time to Event
1, 1, 1, 8.87
2, 1, 2, 9.34
3, 2, 1, 6.78
4, 2, 1, 10.23
5, 2, 1, 9.96
6, 2, 2, 5.6
7, 1, 1, 37.01
8, 1, 2, 28.67
9, 1, 1, 39.70
```

Simulated subjects will be drawn from this supplied list, with
replacement, to provide the simulated response values.
