The analysis tab allows the user to supply a specific data set for
analysis by the design specified in the Design tab of the ".facts" file.

Clicking on the "Use Design to Analyze Data" button, will create an
empty "subject.csv" file in the main simulation results directory and an
'Analysis' sub-directory there for running the analysis and saving the
outputs.

Alternatively, clicking on the "Import Data to Analyze" launches a file
browser, allowing the user to select a '.csv' file to load as the data
to analyze. This is a shortcut for first clicking on the "Use Design to
Analyze Data" button, and then clicking on the "Select File to Create
New Analysis" button on the subject data tab.

After enabling data analysis, the analysis screen is shown with no data
loaded. By clicking on the “Subject Data” tab the user is now able to
enter data values directly, or to load a ‘.csv’ file already containing
data:

# Entering the data directly

For a typical FACTS Core trial, there are normally too many subjects to
want to enter the data directly, but it is possible. Also if data is
first loaded from an external file, it is presented in the same grid as
that used for data entry and additional data can be added or existing
data modified.

The data format is the same as the 'patientsNNNN.csv' output file from
simulations, so it is easy to use these as the basis for a trial
analysis.

:::{.panel-tabset}

### Continuous

Subject ID
: FACTS does not use this value,
it is there to allow the data to be cross-referenced to an external
data source. If not required there is no harm simply entering '1' on
each row.

Region ID
: Region ID is a value output from FACTS simulation, reflecting the
recruiting region the simulated subject was recruited in. It is not
used in analysis, if a region ID is not available there is no harm
simply entering '1' for each subject.

Date
: Date is a real number indicating when the subject was recruited <span class="custom-tooltip"> in
weeks <span class="tooltip-text">This value is in weeks from FACTS 7.0 onwards - before that it was in days.</span> </span> from the start of the trial. It is output from FACTS
simulation, it is not used in analysis. If a date is not available
there is no harm simply entering '1' for each subject.

Arm
: Arm indicates which arm the subject was randomized to: ‘0’ indicates
Control, ‘1’ indicates Treatment.

Group Index
:  Group Index indicates which group the subject presented in. The index
of each arm is visible on the Study \> Study Info tab.

Last Visit#
: Last Visit# is the index of last visit for which there is data for
the subject. Previously FACTS could not process data with data
missing from visits before the last visit. From FACTS 6.2 this is
now possible. Visits for which no data is available should be given
the value "-9999". Data supplied for a subject's visits after 'Last
Visit#' is ignored.

Dropout
: Dropout is a flag, value '0' (not dropped out) or '1' (dropped
out). For a subject that has dropped out, FACTS will apply the
defined value for the subject from the 'Last Visit#'.

Visit1, ...
: These are the subjects response values at the defined visits
  (on the Study tab), up to and including the final visit. -9999 should
  be entered to indicate missing data – values for visits after a
  subjects ‘Last Visit’ are ignored and entering -9999 is not essential
  – but it is clearer.

Duration
: Duration, is the current time for which the subject has been observed,

  subject. If the primary event has been observed, then ‘Duration’
  should be the time to that event from the start of observation of the
  subject.

:::


If data is entered and then 'Run Analysis' clicked, the data is saved to
a file called 'patients.dat' and the analysis results saved to a folder
called 'Analysis' within the "_results" folder of the design.

![Windows file explorer showing the results folder when doing and analysis.](./EDTTE/media/image77.png){#fig-77tte}

The 'Save As' button can be used to save the file with a different name,
but it will still be saved within the _Results folder.

A specific results folder is also created, called 'Analysis_\<file
name\>'.

# Loading Data From a File

As well as entering the data via FACTS its possible to load the data
from a ‘subject.csv’ file. These can be created within FACTS or outside
of FACTS and once created can be edited FACTS or outside of FACTS.

## The subject.csv file format

The file is a simple ascii file with the different data items separated
by commas. Any line starting with '#'' is ignored, here we use that to
include a header row. The data may also include spaces to aid
readability (but **not**, currently, tabs). Each line defines the dose
given to a single subject and that subject's response.

The format of the file is the same as the 'patientsNNNN.csv' output
file ([continuous](./simulation/contanddichot.qmd#contents-of-patientsnnnnn.csv), [dichotomous](./simulation/tte.qmd#contents-of-patientsnnnnn.csv)), or [time-to-event](./simulation/multendpt.qmd#contents-of-patientsnnnnn.csv) and the column values described above.

## Converting arrival date value from days to weeks

From FACTS 7.0 the value in the Date field is interpreted as being in
weeks (rather than days as in previous versions). If you have existing
data, a simple conversion tool is provided "Convert Date from Days to Weeks"
that simply divides all of thete values by 7. Having run the conversion, you
then need to save the modified data. The values of the Date field will only
make a difference to TTE analyses.

# Data file management on the Analysis tab

From FACTS 6.2 onwards FACTS now supports multiple subject data files
and analysis folders.

Buttons that allow the subject data file to be changed:

-   'Select File to Create New Analysis: launches a file browser that
    allows the user to select a new ".csv" file from any location. The
    selected file is copied to the "\_Results" folder (retaining its
    current name) and made the current subject data file.

-   'Rename Current Analysis' allows the name of the current subject
    data file to be changed.

-   'Select Difference Analysis' allows a different subject data file
    that is in the "\_Results" folder to be made the current subject
    data file.

-   'Delete Analysis' allows any of the subject data files that are in
    the "\_Results" folder to be deleted.

The name of the current subject data file and the name of the
corresponding analysis folder are shown below the subject data file
buttons.

There are five buttons that allow the currently loaded subject data file
to be modified:

-   'Delete Row' deletes the currently selected row in the data grid.
    The data in the current subject file is not updated unless the
    current data is saved.

-   'Delete All' clears all the data in the data grid. The data in the
    current subject file is not updated unless the current data is
    saved.

-   'Reload data' replaces the data in the data grid with the data that
    is still in the current subject data file.

-   'Save As' saves the current data in the data grid to a new subject
    data file in the "\_Results" folder, and makes that the current
    subject data file.

-   "Save" saves the current data in the data grid to the current
    subject data file.

Running an analysis performs a 'Save' before running the analysis.

# Running an Analysis

Once data has been loaded or entered, the user can click the 'Run
Analysis' button.

Once the analysis has run, FACTS displays the recommendation, and a
graph showing the data.

- The MCMC parameters

  - “Burn-in” for the number of initial samples that are discarded

  - “Length” for the number of samples drawn to form the posterior
    distributions

  - Random number seed that can be set to generate a different sampling
    sequence

  - Generate MCMC file causes FACTS to write out the full record of the
    MCMC samples of the analysis (which enables the ability to view
    sample history graphs for the model parameters).

  - Edit command line parameters allows expert users to enter command
    line parameters to be passed to the design engine that are not
    settable through this panel.

  - The user specifies which interim the analysis is for and hence which
    decision criteria to be applied

      - The user supplied the interim analysis number or

      - Selects “Do Final Analysis” which causes the analysis to use the
      final evaluation success/futility criteria.

  - The user specifies the current week of the trial if the amount if
    information defined by “opportunity to complete” – otherwise the
    control is disabled.

  - It is possible to flag which if any, groups have stopped and hence
    to be excluded from future adaptation decisions, but included in the
    analysis and which groups have all their information (every subject
    in the group has had their final visit, has dropped out or is no
    longer being followed up).
