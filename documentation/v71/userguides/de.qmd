#  Introduction

## Purpose of this document

This document describes how to install and use the Rule-Based Dose Escalation (DE)
Fixed and Adaptive Clinical Trial Simulator (FACTS) software (from now on referred to as *Dose Escalation Fixed and Adaptive Clinical Trial Simulator Software*). It is
intended for all end users of the system.

## Scope of this document

This document covers the Dose Escalation Fixed and Adaptive Clinical
Trial Simulator Software by describing the user interface. It covers the
3+3 and mTPI. It does not cover the CRM design engine which has [its own User Guide](crm.qmd).

This document does not address the internal workings of the design
engines or algorithms, which are addressed in the associated Design
Engine Specification. It also does not address the use of FACTS Core
Designs or Enrichment Designs, which are covered in other User Guides.

The screenshots provided are specific to a particular installation and
may not reflect the exact layout of the information seen by any
particular user. They were taken from FACTS, 5 or later if changed,
installed on Windows 7 and Windows 10. Different versions of Windows or
the use of different Windows themes will introduce some differences in
appearance. The contents of each tab, however, will be consistent with
the software.

## Context of this Issue 

This document is a guide to the version 7.1 release of Dose Escalation
FACTS.

There have been no changes to these elements of FACTS since FACTS 6.1.

## Citing FACTS

Please cite FACTS wherever applicable using [this citation](../../../introduction/citation.qmd). 

## Definition of Terms

An overview of the acronyms and abbreviations used in this document can be found [here](../glossary.qmd).


# FACTS Overview

The Fixed and Adaptive Clinical Trial Simulator allows designs for a
clinical trial to be evaluated and compared to traditional designs, thus
allowing designs to be optimized. The designs fit a selected model to
endpoints of interest, and evaluate pre-specified decisions based on the
properties of the fitted model. These decisions may include selecting
the dose to allocate to the next subject, and whether sufficient data
has been gathered to allow the trial to be stopped.

There are currently four non-deprecated design engines for Dose Escalation FACTS:
“3+3”, mTPI, N-CRM and 2D-CRM. All design engines are accessed through the singular
interface of the Dose Escalation version of FACTS. 

This User Guide covers “3+3” and mTPI. [CRM](crm.qmd) and 2D-CRM have their own user guides.

## FACTS 7.1 Changes to Dose Escalation

The CRM (Toxicity), CRM (Ordinal), CRM (Efficacy), bCRM are now considered deprecated. Existing designs will still work as expected, but users starting a new design are encouraged to switch over to the new [CRM engine](crm.qmd) if possible. 

## FACTS 7.0 Changes to Dose Escalation

In FACTS 7.0 the only change was on the Analysis tab, when entering
subject data manually, the FACTS GUI now ensures that a cohort number is
entered for every subject.

## FACTS 6.5 Changes to Dose Escalation

In FACTS 6.5 there were no changes to the Dose Escalation simulators.

## FACTS 6.4 Changes to Dose Escalation

In FACTS 6.4 there were no changes to the Dose Escalation simulators.

## FACTS 6.3 Changes to Dose Escalation

In FACTS 6.3 there were no changes to Dose Escalation except in N-CRM
which is described in its own User Guide.

## FACTS 6.1 Changes to Dose Escalation

In FACTS 6.1:

1.  Two new types of design have been added:

    1.  The mTPI design - described in this document.

    2.  The 2D-CRM for phase 1 dose escalation trials of combinations of
        multiple doses of 2 drugs described in the FACTS DE 2D-CRM User
        Guide.

2.  A ‘design variant’ facility has been added to the N-CRM engine that
    allows the user to easily simulate and evaluate an N-CRM design at
    different sample sizes. See the updated FACTS DE N-CRM User Guide
    for details.

3.  Note that from FACTS 6.0 onwards the default MCMC sampling length
    for Dose Escalation designs was increased from 2500 to 25000. This
    was because it was found that with the shorter sampling length the
    results were too inconsistent. It has however significantly slowed
    the speed with which FACTS DE designs are run.

# The FACTS Rules-Based Dose Escalation GUI

The FACTS Rule-Based Dose Escalation GUI conforms to the standard FACTS GUI

- The Study Tab has sub-tabs for entering Study Information and
  specifying the Treatment Arms (doses) available in the study. This is
  where the user specifies the ‘given’ requirements, or constraints, of
  the trial to be designed.

- The Virtual Subject Response tab has sub-tabs for specifying
  Explicitly Defined response profiles to simulate and loading External
  data files of simulated subject responses. This is where a set of
  different toxicities rates per dose are specified that should
  represent the expected ‘space’ of the expected dose-toxicity profiles
  for the compound being tested.

- The Design has sub-tabs for specifying the Allocation Rules, Stopping
  rule and Toxicity Response model. These are the design choices open to
  the trial biostatistician. The expected consequences of these design
  choices to be estimated by running simulations of the trials using the
  various virtual subject response profiles defined.

- On the Simulation Tab, the user controls and runs simulations and can
  view the simulation results.

- On the Analysis tab, the user can load an example data set and view
  the results of the FACTS analysis of that data using the current
  specified design.

![Tab layout of FACTS](deUGattachments/media/image3.png){#fig-fig3}

Figure 4‑1 - Tab layout of FACTS

Also on the menu bar, on the right hand side of the FACTS Window, is a
button labeled “Notes”; clicking this button reveals a simple “notepad”
window in which the user can maintain some simple notes that will be
stored within the “.facts” file.

![The 'Notes' button](deUGattachments/media/image4.png){#fig-fig4}
![Example design notes](deUGattachments/media/image5.png){#fig-fig5}

The notepad window comes with two further buttons: one to change the
window to a free floating one that can be moved away from the FACTCS
window; and the other to close it.

The Notes field can be used for any text the user wishes to store with
the file. Suggested uses are: to record the changes made in a particular
version of a design and why; and to comment on the simulation results.
This will help when coming back to work that has been set aside, to
recall what gave rise to the different version of a design.

## Introduction

To open the application, select FACTS Dose Escalation from your Start
menu. At different points in the FACTS GUI, the user is required to make
decisions about how to model or simulate various aspects of a clinical
trial. To simplify data entry, FACTS shows the user *only* the
information that is relevant to the current decisions.

FACTS has a tabbed design to allow entry of different categories of
information about the design (see Figure 3‑2, as well as the screen
images below).

The **File** menu allows the user to create a new design, open an
existing design, save a design, or copy a design to a new name (Save
as). The saved design includes all parameters entered as well as
simulation results, if they have been produced.

The **Settings** menu provides the ability to configure how simulation
jobs should be submitted to the Grid. Selecting whether to execute
simulations locally or on the Grid is done from the Simulation tab.

The **Help** menu allows the user to learn more about the FACTS software
and verify the application’s version number.

Finally, note that in all tabs of the application, red exclamation
points 

![](deUGattachments/media/image6.png){#fig-fig6}

indicate errors in data
entry from the user that must be corrected. Moving the cursor over the
exclamation point causes a pop-up help text indicating what the error
is, helping the user remedy the error.

## Selecting a Design Model

Once the FACTS application has been opened, the user may select to model
a clinical trial using any of the following design engines from the
introduction screen or the **File \> New \> Dose Escalation** menu:

![](deUGattachments/media/image7.png){#fig-fig7}

Once a design has been selected, the associated form of the GUI will be
displayed, the contents of the tabs and sub-tabs of FACTS displaying the
information relevant to the selected model. Additionally, the model type
selected will appear in the title bar of FACTS to verify the user’s
choice of design.

# Study 

## Study Info

The Study Info sub-tab provides basic study parameters such as Trial
Size and Cohort options, as relevant to the type of design. Depending on
the choice of design engine, the Study info tab may also allow the user
to enter specification for a two-sample population, Toxicity and/or
Efficacy targets, response category options, or Joint Efficacy and
Toxicity options.

- Recruitment, like N-CRM the mTPI design includes the option to use
  Open Enrollment instead of recruitment by cohorts. A phase 1 trial
  using open enrolment recruits ‘all comers’ with a cap on the number of
  subjects who can be treated but have not yet had a final result.
  Subjects that arrive whilst this cap has been reached are deemed to be
  ‘lost’ to the study. If selected the user specifies the following
  additional parameters.

  - Maximum study size (subjects): the maximum number of subjects who
    can be recruited into the study.

  - Mean recruitment ate: for simulation purposes this is the average
    number of subjects who will be expected to be available for
    recruitment during each time period. Recruitment is simulated using
    a standard Poisson process.

  - Time until final result: the time for each subject’s final result to
    become available. This is simulated as a fixed length of time that
    is the same for all subjects.

  - Maximum subjects without a final result: the cap on the number of
    subjects who can be recruited but not yet completed. This is also
    known as the ‘maximum queue length’. Subjects arriving and available
    for recruitment while the number of subjects treated but not yet
    completed is a the cap are dropped and assumed not available for
    recruitment once the current subjects complete but the study has to
    await further new subjects to become available.

- Study Size – (unless an mTPI design using open enrollment) for all
  designs this is specified in terms of the maximum number of cohorts.

  - If the design is CRM(Toxicity) or CRM(Efficacy) and the option to
    include a “Two sample population” analysis is included then the
    Study Size applies to the first sample and with an additional
    parameter the user specifies the maximum size of the second sample,
    also in cohorts.

- Cohort - (unless an mTPI design using open enrollment and if not a
  “3+3” design where cohorts are always of size 3 and must always
  complete before the next cohort is recruited) then the user can
  specify:

  - Cohort size: The number of subjects in each cohort. The maximum
    sample size for the trial is simply: Max Trial Size (cohorts) \*
    Cohort Size.

  - Cohort information delay: Normally left at zero, this allows for the
    trial to be simulated with cohorts recruited more quickly than if
    waiting for the last cohort to complete before treating the next
    cohort. This allows the trial to complete in shorter time, but is
    likely to lead to a larger incidence of toxicities. If the delay is
    set to 1, the second cohort will be recruited before the results for
    the first cohort are available, the third cohort will be recruited
    after the results of the first cohort are available but before the
    results for the second cohort are available, and so on.

- Joint Efficacy and Toxicity – (bCRM only) – there is a flag that the
  user can set to indicate that a subject cannot experience both
  toxicity and efficacy (toxicity censors or prevents efficacy).

<!-- -->

- Single subject run-in – (CRM(Toxixity), bCRM, CRM(Ordinal) only) –
  this allows the user to specify that the trial is to start with a
  single subject run-in. With a single subject run-in, subjects are
  allocated in cohorts of one, incrementing by one dose strength each
  cohort until a toxicity is observed. The user has the option to
  specify whether, on observing the first toxicity, the first full
  cohort is then allocated at that dose, or at the dose below.

- Target – (mTPI only) – somewhat similar to the N-CRM, in mTPI the
  target is defined as toxicity bands rather than single toxicity rate.
  The user specifies the lower and upper bounds of the target toxicity
  band as well as a target toxicity rate within that band.

- The parameters to specify the Toxicity target are displayed for
  CRM(Toxicity), bCRM and CRM(Ordinal) designs. These allow the user to
  specify the maximum tolerated toxicity target and choose which dose
  should be selected based one of the following criteria:

  - nearest dose to target

  - nearest dose above the target (except for ordinal CRM)

  - nearest dose below the target

  - If a control arm is included with the Treatment arms then there is
    the option to specify that the target toxicity rate is relative to
    control, not absolute.

- Similarly the parameters to specify the Efficacy target are displayed
  for CRM(Efficacy) and bCRM. These allow the user to specify the
  maximum tolerated toxicity target and choose which dose should be
  selected based one of the following criteria:

  - nearest dose to target

  - nearest dose above the target (except for ordinal CRM)

  - nearest dose below the target

  - If a control arm is included with the Treatment arms then there is
    the option to specify that the target efficacy rate is relative to
    control, not absolute.

- Cohort Expansion – (all designs except CRM(Efficacy) The user can
  specify that after the dose escalation phase of the trial has
  completed, the simulation is to include an ‘expansion cohort’
  allocated at the final value of the target dose, and how large that
  expansion cohort will be.

  - If a Control arm has been included, then there can be a specific
    allocation to Control as well (these are taken from the overall
    cohort size, they are not additional to it).

  - In bCRM the user selects whether the expansion cohort is allocated
    to the MTD, MED or OSD.

Figure 5‑1 displays the Study Info sub-tab for a bCRM design. The
functionality and look of the tab is similar for other CRM designs and
mTPI.

![Study Info (bCRM)](deUGattachments/media/image16.png){#fig-fig16}

## Treatment Arms

The Treatment Arms sub-tab (@fig-fig17) provides an interface for
specifying the various dose levels, and (except in “3+3”) a Control
treatment arm.

If a control arm is included:

- Target rates can be specified to be relative to control (otherwise
  they are absolute).

- A specific number of subjects are specified to be allocated to control
  in each cohort

- The response on the Control arm can be included in the dose response
  model, or modeled separately (using a simple beta-binomial model) in
  which case monotonicity is not enforced.

The user may add doses either explicitly or by auto-generation, as
depicted below. The user may also edit the Dose Names within the table
by double clicking on any existing dose name, however the index cannot
be edited.

Note that the CRM designs use transformed dose levels, and unlike the
Dose Finding designs do not have a relative dose level specified.

![Treatment Arms](deUGattachments/media/image17.png){#fig-fig17}

#  Virtual Subject Response

The Virtual Subject Response tab allows the user to explicitly define
response profiles, and/or to import files of virtual subject responses.
When simulations are executed, they will be run separately for each
profile defined by the user.

## Explicitly Defined

### Toxicity \[3+3, CRM(Toxicity), mTPI and bCRM\]

The Toxicity sub-tab provides an interface for specifying one or more
Toxicity profiles.

Toxicity profiles may be added, deleted, and renamed using the table and
corresponding buttons on the left hand side of the screen in Figure 6‑1.
Toxicity values are entered directly into the Probability of Toxicity
column of the table, and the graphical representation of these toxicity
values updates accordingly. The graph may be modified by plotting the
log of the dose strength as the x-axis, and by plotting the logit or the
probability of toxicity as the y-axis.

This graph – as with all graphs in the application – may be easily
copied using the ‘Copy Graph’ option in the context menu accessed by
right-clicking on the graph. The user is given the option to copy the
graph to their clipboard (for easy pasting into other applications, such
as Microsoft Word or PowerPoint), or to save the graph as an image file.

![Toxicity Virtual Subject Response (bCRM)](deUGattachments/media/image18.png){#fig-fig18}

When using a bCRM design engine, if the Toxicity and Efficacy profiles
are specified separately, then the results are simulated without
correlation. To simulate correlation in the results it is necessary to
specify joint profiles.

### Toxicity with 2 Samples \[CRM(Toxicity)\]

If utilizing a CRM (Toxicity) design, the user has the option to model
two sample populations (this option may be selected on the Study Info
tab, as described in Section 5.1). If the user elects to enable the
modeling of two samples, then the Toxicity sub-tab allows the user to
input probabilities of Toxicity for each sample, as displayed in Figure
6‑2 below.

![Toxicity Virtual Subject Response with 2 samples (CRM (Toxicity))](deUGattachments/media/image19.png){#fig-fig19}

###  

### Ordinal Toxicity \[CRM(Ordinal)\]

For CRM (Ordinal) designs, the user must specify the probability of
toxicity at or above each category. Ordinal designs can use either three
or four categories, with a category three toxicity corresponding to a
toxic response in a CRM (Toxicity) design. Toxicity data must be entered
for each category greater than 1 and must be monotonically decreasing
with category (@fig-fig20).

![Toxicity Virtual Subject Response (CRM (Ordinal))](deUGattachments/media/image20.png){#fig-fig20}

### Efficacy \[CRM (Efficacy) and bCRM\]

Similar to the Toxicity sub-tab, the Efficacy sub-tab provides an
interface for specifying one or more Efficacy profiles.

Efficacy profiles may be added, deleted, and renamed using the table and
corresponding buttons on the left hand side of the screen.

Efficacy values are entered directly into the Probability of Efficacy
column of the table, and the graphical representation of these efficacy
values updates accordingly.

If utilizing a bCRM design, in which both Toxicity and Efficacy profiles
are utilized, the user must ensure that profile names are unique. FACTS
does not allow the user to enter Toxicity profiles and Efficacy profiles
which are named identically.

Finally, if utilizing a CRM (Efficacy) design, the user has the option
to model two sample populations (this option may be selected on the
Study Info tab, as described in Section 5.1). If the user elects to
enable the modeling of two samples, then the Efficacy sub-tab allows the
user to input probabilities of Efficacy for each sample, just as in the
case of CRM (Toxicity) illustrated in Figure 6‑2.

![Efficacy Virtual Subject Response (CRM Efficacy)](deUGattachments/media/image21.png){#fig-fig21}

### Joint Efficacy / Toxicity \[bCRM\]

The Joint Efficacy / Toxicity sub-tab (@fig-fig22) allows the user to
specify the probability of efficacy, toxicity, and success at each dose.

Joint profiles may be added, deleted, and renamed using the table and
corresponding buttons on the left hand side of the screen in Figure 6‑5.
The user must ensure that any profile name entered on this tab is unique
from all other profile names in the application, whether on this tab, or
on the Toxicity sub-tab or the Efficacy sub-tab.

Probabilities of toxicity, efficacy, and success are entered directly
into the table, and the graphical representation of these probabilities
updates accordingly. Success is the probability of observing efficacy
without toxicity, thus the rate for success is naturally bounded:

- The probability of success at a dose cannot exceed the probability of
  efficacy at that dose.

- The probability of success at a dose cannot exceed (1 – the
  probability of toxicity) at that dose.

- The probability of success cannot be less than the probability of
  efficacy minus the probability of toxicity at that dose.

    If the user enters probabilities violating these limit, then FACTS
    mark them as invalid and will refuse to simulate the scenarios
    including the profile. FACTS reports to the user, on the Simulation
    tab, that the following error has been found: “True toxicity and
    Efficacy curve is not in range \[0,1\]” and will ask the user to
    resolve the error before running simulations.

Joint Efficacy / Toxicity profiles may also be generated from models,
rather than explicitly. This way of specifying Joint Efficacy / Toxicity
profiles is described in Section 6.3.

![Joint Efficacy](deUGattachments/media/image22.png){#fig-fig22}

## External

Subject response data may be simulated from a PK-PD model in place of or
in addition to choosing a response model from FACTS. The importing of
subject response data (which must be in the form specified in the System
Requirements Document) may be done from the External Files sub-tab
depicted below (@fig-fig23).

To import an external file, the user must first add a profile to the
table. After adding a profile, the user must click “Browse” to locate
the externally simulated data. The user will then be prompted to locate
the external file on their computer with a dialog box.

![External Data](deUGattachments/media/image23.png){#fig-fig23}

## Parametric \[bCRM\]

The Parametric sub-tab allows the user to specify the Joint Efficacy /
Toxicity profiles as modeled by Cox or Gumbel functions. This allowance
is in contrast to the explicit definition of Joint Efficacy / Toxicity
profiles, as may be done in the Joint Efficacy / Toxicity sub-tab of the
Explicitly Defined Response tab (see Section 6.1.3).

The interface of the Parametric tab is displayed below (@fig-fig24). As
with other Virtual Response sub-tabs, profiles may be added, deleted,
and renamed using the table and corresponding buttons on the left hand
side of the screen in @fig-fig24.

![bCRM Parametric Joint Toxicity & Efficacy VSR - Cox Model](deUGattachments/media/image24.png){#fig-fig24}

![bCRM Parametric Joint Toxicity & Efficacy VSR - Gumbel Model](deUGattachments/media/image25.png){#fig-fig25}

# Design

The Design Tab allows the user to select allocation and sampling rules,
and to select toxicity and efficacy models from among a list available
for this release. Stopping criteria may also be set from within the
Design tab.

## Toxicity and Efficacy Response tabs \[CRM (Efficacy), CRM (Toxicity) and bCRM\]

On the Toxicity and Efficacy Response sub-tabs, the user may choose
toxicity and efficacy models from among a list available for this
release. The supported models for modeling toxicity and efficacy
response in this release are logistic, tanh, and power for one sample
studies, and tanh (x-b) for two sample studies.

The user has the option to set the Minimum and Maximum parameter values,
which define the toxicity/efficacy asymptotes. These values are used to
rescale the probabilities and calculated the scaled dose values, X^
(X-hat). These default to 0 and 1, but if the endpoint being observed is
expected to have a background rate (that would be observed even if
placebo were administered) or a natural maximum rate (that would not be
exceeded whatever the strength of dose used), then the model fitting
will be improved

The Toxicity Response tab is depicted below in @fig-fig26; the Efficacy
Response tab has a similar appearance.

![Toxicity Response (bCRM)](deUGattachments/media/image26.png){#fig-fig26}

The user selects the model type:

- Logisitic, in which case the fixed value for the Alpha parameter is
  specified (usually this is set to 3 – giving a toxicity rate of 0.953
  at a dose with a transformed dose strength of 0. Effective dose
  strengths should typically be in the range (-8, -1)

- Tanh in which case the effective dose strengths should typically be in
  the range (-2, 1)

- Power in which case the effective dose strengths should typically be
  in the range (0,1)

The user specified the prior distribution of the estimated model
parameter (Beta) either as an Exponential (1) distribution or a uniform
distribution (0,U) where U is specified by the user.

The effective dose strengths of the doses are specified in the “Model
Priors” table. They can be specified in one of two ways:

- By defining a prior probability of toxicity for each dose. The
  corresponding transformed dose strength is then calculated as the
  value that would yield that toxicity rate from the model with Beta=1.
  The corresponding transformed dose strength is shown in the right hand
  column. Care needs to be taken with this approach that the resulting
  transformed dose strengths are well spaced out – this can be checked
  on the graph that shows the transformed dose strengths, and the
  corresponding toxicity rate on the graph of the Beta=1 model.

- Be specifying the effective dose strength explicitly. Care needs to be
  taken with this approach, depending on the model this may yield
  nonsensical toxicity rates, but once the correct range for the
  transformed doses is understood, it easier to ensure a good spacing of
  the transformed dose strengths.

## Toxicity Response tab \[CRM(Ordinal)\]

![CRM(Ordinal) Toxicity Response tab](deUGattachments/media/image27.png){#fig-fig27}


## Design tab \[mTPI\]

The mTPI method has two parameters that can be specified

- The first is an option to prevent re-escalating to a dose (the “DU” or
  Do not Use category in the diagram) if the posterior probability that
  the toxicity rate is above the target toxicity plus the delta:
  p<sub>T</sub>+ε<sub>U</sub> (on the Study \> Study Info tab this is
  the “Upper Bound” parameter) exceeds a specified threshold (0.95 is
  the default).

- The second is an option that allows an early stopping rule to be
  specified that if the dose to be allocated next already has the
  maximum number of subjects on it then it is declared the MTD. Setting
  this value shrinks the size of the table displayed.

Given the target toxicity rate and the boundaries specified on the Study
\> Study Info tab, and the parameters specified here the table of mTPI
dosing decisions is displayed. This shows the dosing decision given the
number of subject treated at the current dose and the number of
toxicities observed:

> E Escalate
>
> S Stay
>
> D De-escalate
>
> DU De-escalate and do not revisit

![mTPI Design tab](deUGattachments/media/image28.png){#fig-fig28}

## Allocation Rule 

The Allocation Rule sub-tab is depicted below (Figure 7‑2); it allows
the user to set basic allocation parameters, including Maximum Dose
Increment, Minimum Cohorts on Dose prior to Increment, and Maximum
number of Cohorts used to determine MTD (bCRM only).

The dose range may be split with a greater maximum increment allowed in
the upper part of the range than in the lower.

When specifying the maximum dose increment, the user has two options of
how to apply that increment; relative to the current dose or relative to
the highest dose with a specified number of cohorts. In other words, the
largest possible value for the next allocation at any point in the trial
is either the current dose level plus the Maximum Dose Increment, or the
highest dose that has been allocated to Max Subjects Before Incrementing
*plus* the Maximum Dose Increment.

![Design & Allocation Rule tab (CRM Toxicity)](deUGattachments/media/image29.png){#fig-fig29}


Also on this tab, the user may specify sampling rule parameters, namely
the initial dose level for sampling. If using a “3+3” design, the
sampling rule parameters will be the only parameters on this screen (and
hence the tab will be called “Sampling Rule” in place of “Allocation
Rule”), since allocation does not apply to the “3+3” design engine.

![Design & Allocation Rule tab (bCRM)](deUGattachments/media/image30.png){#fig-fig30}

If utilizing a CRM (Toxicity) design, and if the option to model two
sample populations has been enabled (this option may be selected on the
Study Info tab, as described in Section 5.1), the user also has the
option to set the initial dose for the second population.

Additionally, a single subject run-in can also be specified on the
Allocation Rule tab. A single subject run-in starts at the specified
starting dose and allocates a single subject to each dose until either a
toxicity is observed or the maximum dose is reached. This option is
available for CRM (Toxicity), CRM (Ordinal), and bCRM only. Note that
subjects in the single subject run-in are not included in the “max trial
size”, so with a single subject run-in, it is possible to end a
simulation with more subjects that were specified in the max trial size.

If a Control treatment arm has been included, the user must also specify
the number of subjects per cohort that should be allocated to Control.
The Control dose is treated differently than the active doses, and
cannot ever be found as the MTD or MED. Thus, it will never be assigned
a cohort based on the fitted model, and must have subjects assigned per
cohort.

Finally, if utilizing a CRM (Efficacy) design, the user also has the
option on this tab to allocate extra subjects to the min or max dose, as
shown in Figure 7‑3. “Probability gamma” is used to ensure that the
numbers of subjects allocated to the maximum and minimum stay close to
their specified values. Setting gamma (*γ*) to 0 turns this off, so the
actual number allocated may drift away from the number expected. 2 is a
good value to enable this correction.

The formula used is:

$p = p_T^{\gamma (p_O - p_T)}$

where *p<sub>T</sub>* is the target probability as entered above,
*p<sub>O</sub>* is the observed probability measured from the subjects
allocated so far and *p* is corrected the probability that will be used
in allocation. To prevent wild allocations, *p* is subject to the
restrictions, *p*\<0.5 and *p<sub>T</sub>*/4 \< *p* \< 4*p<sub>T</sub>*.

![Allocation Rule (CRM (Efficacy))](deUGattachments/media/image32.png){#fig-fig32}

Figure 8‑6 - Allocation Rule (CRM (Efficacy))

When a Control treatment arm is included, it is treated as the minimum
dose, and gives the user another option of how to allocate to it. In
this case, the user can specify a probability of allocating whole
cohorts to the Control, or a number of subjects per cohort allocated to
Control. The two options cannot be combined.

## Stopping Criteria (CRM (Efficacy), CRM (Toxicity), CRM (Ordinal), N-CRM and bCRM only)

For any design, including “3+3”, study simulation will always stop when
the maximum number of subjects has been achieved.

The study simulation may also stop early when the following conditions
that have been enabled by the user are met:

- MTD finding (CRM (Toxicity), N-CRM and bCRM only)

  - the user-specified minimum number of subjects are allocated to the
    MTD

  - AND the following optional rules either ANDed or ORed together.

    - The number of dose levels in the specified confidence interval
      meets the specified the threshold

    - There is a dose with a probability of being the MTD that is
      greater than the specified threshold.

    - The minimum number of cohorts have been accrued

- MED finding (CRM (Efficacy) and bCRM only)

  - the user-specified maximum number of subjects are allocated to the
    MED

  - the number of dose levels in the confidence interval meets the
    specified number

  - there is a dose with a probability of being MED that is greater than
    the specified threshold

  - The minimum number of cohorts have been accrued

- mTPI when the user specified number of subjects are already allocated
  to the next dose to be allocated – this is specified on the mTPI
  Design tab.

When studying two samples, stopping rules will be evaluated and applied
separately for each sample.

These parameters are set on the Stopping Criteria sub-tab as depicted
below in @fig-fig33 Stopping tab CRM Toxicity.

![Stopping tab CRM Toxicity](deUGattachments/media/image33.png){#fig-fig33}

For bCRM the stopping rules become the rules for stopping the MTD phase
and starting the MED phase. There are then similar rules that can be
used for stopping the MED phase early.

![Stopping Criteria (bCRM)](deUGattachments/media/image34.png){#fig-fig34}

Finally, if utilizing a CRM (Efficacy) design, the user may specify an
additional set of parameters for stopping for futility, as displayed at
the bottom of Figure 7‑5. These allow the trial to be stopped early for
futility. If the user enable these rules then the user can specify:

- That a minimum number of cohorts must have been allocated to the
  minimum and maximum doses.

- That the trial will stop unless there is a minimum difference in the
  mean response between the minimum and maximum doses.

# Simulation

The Simulation tab allows the user to execute simulations for each of
the scenarios specified for the study. The user may choose the number of
simulations, whether to execute locally or on the Grid, and modify the
random number seeds (@fig-fig36).

If completed results are available, the *actual* number of simulations
run for each scenario is reported in one of the first columns of the
results table. The value displayed in the “Number of Simulations”
control is the number of simulations that *will be* run if the user
clicks on the ‘Simulate’ button.

![Simulation](deUGattachments/media/image36.png){#fig-fig36}

N.B. FACTS uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in the generation of
simulated patient response data and trial results. In order to exactly
reproduce a statistical set of results, it is necessary to start the
Markov Chain from an identical “Random Seed”. The initial random seed
for FACTS simulations is set from the simulation tab, the first thing
that FACTS does is to draw the random number seeds to use at the start
of each simulation. It is possible to re-run a specific simulation, for
example to have more detailed output files generated, by specifying
‘start at simulation’.

Say the 999<sup>th</sup> simulation out of a set displayed some unusual
behavior, in order to understand why, one might want to see the
individual interim analyses for that simulation (the “weeks” file), the
sampled subject results for that simulation (the “Subjects” files) and
possibly even the MCMC samples from the analyses in that simulation. You
can save the .facts file with a slightly different name (to preserve the
existing simulation results), then run 1 simulation of the specific
scenario, specifying that the simulations start at simulation 999 and
that at least 1 weeks file, 1 subjects file and the MCMC samples file
(see the “MCMC settings” dialog) are output.

Even a small change in the random seed will produce different simulation
results.

The same random number seed is used at the start of the simulation of
each scenario. If two identical scenarios are specified then identical
simulation results will be obtained. The same may happen if scenarios or
designs only differ in ways that have no impact on the trials being
simulated, for instance designs that have no adaptation, or scenarios
that don’t trigger any adaptation (e.g. none of the simulations stop
early).

The user can specify:

- the number of simulations for which ‘Cohorts’ files are written.
  ‘Cohorts’ files record the data, analysis and recommendation at each
  interim (after each cohort).

- The parallelization packet size, this allows simulation jobs to be
  split into runs of no-more than the specified number of trials to
  simulate. If more simulations of a scenario are requested than can be
  done in one packet, the simulations are started as the requisite
  number of packets and the results combined and summarized when they
  are all complete – so the final results files look just as though all
  the simulations were run as one job or packet. When running
  simulations on the local machine FACTS enterprise version will process
  as many packets in parallel as there are execution threads on the
  local machine. The overhead of packetisation is quite low so a packet
  size of 10 to 100 can help speed up the overall simulation process –
  threads used to simulate scenarios that finish quicker can pick up
  packets for scenarios that take longer, if the number of scenarios is
  no directly divisible by the number of threads packetisation uses all
  threads until the last few packets have to be run and finally the
  “Simulations complete” figure can be updated at the end of each
  packet, so the small the packet the better FACTS can report the
  overall progress.

## To run simulations

Click in the check box in each of the rows corresponding the to the
scenarios to be run. FACTS displays a row for each possible combination
of the ‘profiles’ that have been specified: - baseline response, dose
response, longitudinal response, accrual rate and dropout rate. Or
simply click on “Select All”.

Then click on the “Simulate” button.

During simulation, the user may not modify any parameters on any other
tab of the application. This safeguard ensures that the simulation
results reflect the parameters specified in the user interface.

When simulations are started, FACTS saves all the study parameters, and
when the simulations are complete all the simulation results are saved
in results files in a “\_results” folder in the same directory as the
“.facts” file. Within the “\_results” folder there will be a sub-folder
that holds the results for each scenario.

## How many simulations to run?

- After first entering a design it is worth running just a small number
  of simulations such as 10 to check that the scenarios and design have
  been entered correctly. If all 10 simulations of a ‘null’ scenario are
  successful, or all 10 simulations of what was intended to be an
  effective drug scenario are futile, it is likely there has been a
  mistake or misunderstanding in the specification of the scenarios or
  the final evaluation or early stopping criteria.

- Once the design and scenarios look broadly correct, it is usually
  worth quickly collecting rough estimates of the operating
  characteristics using around 100 simulations for each scenario. 100
  simulations is enough to spot designs having very poor operating
  characteristics such as very high type-1 error, very poor power, a
  strong tendency to stop early for the wrong reason, or poor
  probability of selecting the correct target. 100 simulations is also
  usually sufficient to spot problems with the data analysis such as
  poor model fits and significant bias in the posterior estimates.

- Typically 1,000 simulations of each scenario of interest is required
  to get estimates of the operating characteristics precise enough to
  compare designs and tune the parameters. (Very roughly rates of 5%
  (such as type-1 error) can be estimated to about +/-1.5% and rates of
  around 80% (such as power) estimated +/- 2.5%)

- Finally around 10,000 simulations of the scenarios of interest is
  required to give confidence in operating characteristics of a design
  and possibly to select between the final shortlisted designs
  (Approximately rates of 5% can be estimated to about +/-0.5% and rates
  of around 80% estimated +/- 1%).

There may be many operating characteristics need to be compared over a
number of scenarios, such as expected sample size, type-1 error, power,
probability of selecting a good dose as the target and quality of
estimation of the dose-response.

However frequently these will be compared over a range of scenarios, it
may not be necessary to run very large number of simulations for each
scenario if a design shows a consistent advantage on the key operating
characteristics over the majority of the scenarios.

### Simulation results

In the main screen the summary results that are usually of principal
interest are displayed, the results summarised by scenario.

- **Show other columns**: Allows the user to open additional windows on
  the simulation results, the windows available are:

  - **All**: A window containing all the summary results columns

  - **Highlights**: (all) a separate window with the results shown on
    the main tab

  - **Allocation, Observed**: (all) summary results of the number of
    subjects allocated, the number allocated to each dose, the number of
    toxicities observed and the number of toxicities observed per dose

  - **Fitted toxicity/efficacy/response**: (all CRM) summary results of
    the estimates of the model parameters and the dose-toxicity.

  - **Pr(MTD) etc / Pr(MED) etc**: (all CRM) summary results of the
    posterior probabilities of the properties of interest. In bCRM these
    values are organised in three groupings called “Probabilities”,
    “Toxicity” and “Efficacy”.

  - **Simulation Results**: a window displaying the individual
    simulation results for each simulation of the currently selected
    scenario

  - **Two Sample results:** (CRM Toxicity)

- **View Graph**: opens the FACTS built in graph utility displaying the
  results for the currently selected scenario. See Section 11 below for
  a description of the graphs.

- **Aggregate**: opens a control that allows the user create aggregated
  results files from all the scenarios. The user can select which
  scenarios to include, and whether the results should be pivoted by
  dose. The resulting files are stored in the simulation results folder.

- **Open in R**: If aggregated files have been created then clicking
  this button on the simulations tab will open control that allows the
  user to select which aggregations to load into data frames as R is
  opened. Otherwise it will offer to open R using the files in the
  currently selected scenario.

- *Right Click Menu:* right clicking the mouse on a row of results in
  the simulation tab brings up a ‘local’ menu of options:

  - **Open results folder**: Opens a file browser in the results folder
    of the scenario, allowing swift access to any of the results files.

  - **Simulation results**: Opens a window displaying the individual
    simulation results for each simulation of the currently selected
    scenario

  - **Open in R**: opens a control that will launch R, first loading the
    selected files in the results folder as data frames.

  - **View Graphs**: launches the graph viewer to view the results of
    the currently selected scenario.

### MCMC Settings

![](deUGattachments/media/image37.png){#fig-fig37}

The first two values specify two standard MCMC parameters –

- The length of burn-in is the number of the initial iterations whose
  results are discarded, to allow the sampled values to settle down.

- The number of samples is the number of subsequent iterations whose
  results are recorded in order to give posterior estimates of the
  values of interest (in this case α and β).

If the **Number of MCMC samples to output** value is set to N, where N
\> 0, then all the sampled values at each interim in the first N
simulations are output, allowing the user to check convergence.

To obtain the MCMC sampled values for a particular simulation, keep the
same Random number seed and use **Start at simulation** to specify the
simulation in question and run just 1 simulation.

## FACTS Grid Simulation Settings

If you have access to a computational grid, you may choose to have your
simulations run on the grid instead of running them locally. This frees
your computer from the computationally intensive task of simulating so
you can continue other work or even shutdown your PC or laptop. In order
to run simulations on the grid, it must first be configured, this is
normally done via a configuration file supplied with the FACTS
installation by the IT group responsible for the FACTS installation.

## Detailed Simulation Results

After simulation has completed and simulation results have been loaded,
the user may examine detailed results for any scenario with simulation
data in the table by double-clicking on the row. A separate window (as
in @fig-fig38) will reveal more detailed results about the simulation.


![Detailed Simulation Results](deUGattachments/media/image38.png){#fig-fig38}

Right-clicking on a row displays a context menu from which the user can
also view the corresponding cohort results:

![bCRM Parametric Joint Toxicity & Efficacy VSR - Gumbel Model](deUGattachments/media/image39.png){#fig-fig39}

## Aggregation

Aggregation combines the csv output from multiple scenarios into fewer
csv files. The Aggregate… button displays a dialog which allows the user
to select what to aggregate.

![](deUGattachments/media/image40.png){#fig-fig40}

The default location for the aggregated files is the results directory
for the study, but this can be changed.

Aggregation may be performed with or without pivoting on group, or both.

- Unpivoted files will have one row for each row in the original files.

- In pivoted files each original row will be split into one row per
  dose, plus two extra rows for ‘below lowest’ and ‘above highest’.

  - Where there is a group of columns for each dose, they will be turned
    into a single column with each value on a new row.

  - If there is no value for the below lowest or above highest rows,
    they will be left blank.

  - Values in columns that are independent of group will be repeated on
    each row.

The default is to aggregate all scenarios, but any combination may be
selected.

Pressing “Aggregate” generates the aggregated files.

Each type of csv file is aggregated into a separate csv file whose name
begins agg\_ or agg_pivot\_, so agg_summary.csv will contain the rows
from each of the summary.csv files, unpivoted. cohortsNNN.csv files are
aggregated into a single agg\_\[pivot\_\]cohorts.csv file. Doses.csv is
identical for all scenarios and so is not aggregated.

Each aggregated file begins with the following extra columns, followed
by the columns from the original csv file:

| Column Name | Comments |
|----|-------|
| Scenario ID | Index of the scenario |
| Toxicity Profile | A series of columns containing the names of the various profiles used to construct the scenario. Columns that are never used are omitted (e.g External Subjects Profile if there are no external scenarios) |
| External Subjects Profile |  |
| Agg Timestamp | Date and time when aggregation was performed |
| Sim | Simulation number. Only present in the cohorts file. |
| Dose | Only present if pivoted |

# Graphs of Simulation Results

The ‘View Graph’ button on the simulation tab also allows the user to
view Summary graphs for the currently selected row of data in the
summary results table. A separate Summary Graphs window will appear. The
types of graphs available for viewing are listed in the left-hand side
of the window; clicking on a graph type displays that graph. Note that
some graphs will not be available if they are not relevant to the type
of design the user has simulated. By right clicking on the graph the
user can access the context menu that allows a copy of the graph to be
copied to the Windows’ clipboard or saved as an image (‘.png’) file.

## Allocation Box and Whisker plot (All)

![Allocation Box and Whisker plot](deUGattachments/media/image42.png){#fig-fig42}

This graph displays a box and whisker plot of the number of subjects
allocated to each dose over the simulations. These plots show:

- The mean allocation over all simulations at each dose plotted as a
  solid line.

- The median value is plotted as a dashed line.

- The 25-75<sup>th</sup> quantile range is plotted as the “box” portion
  of each point.

- The “whiskers” extend to the largest and smallest values within 1 ½
  times the interquartile range from either end of the box.

- Points outside the whisker range are considered outliers, and are
  plotted as small blue dots. Note that it may be difficult to see all
  of these symbols if they are plotted at the same value.

In CRM(Toxicity) if two samples (two populations) are used then there
are separate plots for each sample.

## Resp and Subject Alloc (all CRM)

| **CRM Toxicity, CRM Ordinal** | **CRM Efficacy** |
|----|----|

| **bCRM** |  |
| ![](deUGattachments/media/image45.png){#fig-fig45} |  |

These graphs show the mean subject allocation to each dose as a blue
bar, along with, as appropriate lines showing the mean estimated
toxicity/efficacy and the simulated ‘true’ toxicity/efficacy. The
‘error’ bars on the mean estimated toxicity/efficacy are the 95%
interval of the mean estimates across the simulations.

In CRM(Toxicity) if two samples (two populations) are used then there
are separate plots for each sample.

## Distribution of MTD, MED, OSD and TE

MTD: Maximum Tolerated Dose

MED: Minimum Effective Dose

OSD: Optimum Selected Dose – if the MED is below the MTD then the OSD is
the MED, otherwise it is the MTD.

TE: Tolerated and Effective – the probability the dose is both below the
MTD and above the MTD. In the results file this is under the column
heading “Pr(Good)”.

| **3+3 version** | **CRM Toxicity, CRM Ordinal, bCRM - MTD** |
|----|----|

| ![](deUGattachments/media/image48.png){#fig-fig48} | ![](deUGattachments/media/image49.png){#fig-fig49} |

These graphs show the proportion of times each dose has been selected as
a particular target dose as a brown bar, along with lines showing the
mean estimated toxicity/efficacy and the simulated ‘true’
toxicity/efficacy. The ‘error’ bars on the mean estimated
toxicity/efficacy are the 95% interval of the mean estimates across the
simulations.

In CRM(Toxicity) if two samples (two populations) are used then there
are separate plots for each sample.

These graph show the mean allocation to each dose and the mean number of
toxicities/efficacies observed at each dose.

In CRM(Toxicity) if two samples (two populations) are used then there
are separate plots for each sample.

## MTD Credible Interval

![](deUGattachments/media/image52.png){#fig-fig52}

Currently only available for CRM Toxicity, this histogram shows the
distribution of the final number of doses in the MTD credible interval.

In CRM(Toxicity) if two samples (two populations) are used then there
are separate plots for each sample.

## Sample Size MTD Histogram (All CRM)

![](deUGattachments/media/image53.png){#fig-fig53}

This graph plots the distribution of the final sample sizes a a stacked
bar chart with different shades of color indicating the proportion of
simulations with that sample size had selected the different doses as
MTD.

## Simulation Allocation History

|----|----|
| 3+3 version, CRM Toxicity, bCRM | CRM Ordinal |
| ![](deUGattachments/media/image56.png){#fig-fig56} |  |
| CRm Efficacy, bCRM |  |

This graph shows the allocation and toxicity/efficacy history for an
individual simulation. Each dot represents a subject, the dot is colored
red if toxicity was observed, light pink for a mild toxicity, blue for
efficacy and grey otherwise. The subjects’ outcomes are displayed left
to right in the order in which they were dosed, and at a height
corresponding to the dose they were given.

The graph includes a drop down selector box allowing the user to select
which simulated trial is displayed. A history can only be displayed for
trials for which a ‘cohorts’ file has been written out.

In CRM(Toxicity) if two samples (two populations) are used then there
are separate plots for each sample.

## Cohort Responses Sample (All CRM except Efficacy)

| **CRM Toxicity** | **CRM Ordinal** |
|----|----|
| ![](deUGattachments/media/image57.png){#fig-fig57} | ![](deUGattachments/media/image58.png){#fig-fig58} |
| **bCRM** |  |
| ![](deUGattachments/media/image59.png){#fig-fig59} |  |

This graph shows the dose allocation and resulting toxicities/efficacies
along with the fitted dose-toxicity/efficacy model for a single
simulated trial after the results have been gathered for a specific
cohort of a specific trial.

The graph includes a drop down selector box allowing the user to select
which simulated trial is displayed, and a further drop down selector box
allowing the user to select at which cohort to display the state of the
trial.

These details can only be displayed for trials for which a ‘cohorts’
file has been written out.

In CRM(Toxicity) if two samples (two populations) are used then there
are separate plots for each sample.

## MTD Change on Expansion

![MTD change on expansion graph](deUGattachments/media/image60.png){#fig-fig60}

This graph plots the dose selected as MTD before the results of the
expansion cohort are available, against the dose selected as MTD after
the expansion cohort results are available. Each simulation result is
plotted as a ‘dot’, and the graph is divided up into a grid and dots
located in the correct cell in the grid and then arranged within the
cell depending on how many results fall into the cell. This allows the
relative number of results in each cell to be appraised quickly by eye.

This graph allows the trial designer to see the degree of risk that the
determination of the MTD will change as a result of the expansion cohort
and whether the risk is predominantly that the determination will
increase or decrease.

There are similar graphs showing the change in the estimate of the MED
and OSD after the expansion cohort.

# Output Files

FACTS stores the results of simulations as csv files under a Results
folder. For each row in the simulations table, there is a folder named
by concatenating the names of all the different parts, which contains
the corresponding csv files.

Right-clicking on a row in any of the results tables displays a context
menu from which includes an option to open the results folder in
explorer.

These files can be opened using Microsoft Excel, but versions before
2007 are restricted to 256 columns, which is too few to view some files
in their entirety. Open Office will show all the columns and it will
allow you to open two files that have the same name.

There are several types of file:

**Summary.csv** – contains a single row of data that holds data
summarized across the simulations. This is the source of most of the
values in the simulations table.

**Simulations.csv** – contains one row per simulation describing the
final state of each simulation.

**CohortsNNN.csv** – contains one row for each cohort during a
simulation where NNN is the number of the simulation. By default this
file is written only for the first 100 simulations, but this can be
changed via the advanced button on the simulation tab.

If there are two sample populations (Toxicity only or Efficacy only),
results for the second sample are written to files named summary2.csv,
simulations2.csv and cohorts2_NNN.csv.

### Aggregation

The results files can be aggregated using the “Aggregate…” button on the
Simulations tab.

The Aggregate… button displays a dialog which allows the user to select
what to aggregate:

![](deUGattachments/media/image61.png){#fig-fig61}

The default location for the aggregated files is the results directory
for the study, but this can be changed.

Aggregation may be performed with or without pivoting on group, or both.

- Unpivoted files will have one row for each row in the original files.

- In pivoted files each original row will be split into one row per
  dose, plus two extra rows for ‘below lowest’ and ‘above highest’.

  - Where there is a group of columns for each dose, they will be turned
    into a single column with each value on a new row.

  - If there is no value for the below lowest or above highest rows,
    they will be left blank.

  - Values in columns that are independent of group will be repeated on
    each row.

The default is to aggregate all scenarios, but any combination may be
selected.

Pressing “Aggregate” generates the aggregated files.

Each type of csv file is aggregated into a separate csv file whose name
begins agg\_ or agg_pivot\_, so agg_summary.csv will contain the rows
from each of the summary.csv files, unpivoted. Files for the two samples
are aggregated into separate files. cohortsNNN.csv files are aggregated
into a single agg\_\[pivot\_\]cohorts.csv file. Doses.csv is identical
for all scenarios and so is not aggregated.

Each aggregated file begins with the following extra columns, followed
by the columns from the original csv file:

| Column Name | Comments |
|----|--------|
| Scenario ID | Index of the scenario |
| Toxicity Profile | A series of columns containing the names of the various profiles used to construct the scenario. Columns that are never used are omitted (e.g External Subjects Profile if there are no external scenarios) |
| External Subjects Profile |  |
| Agg Timestamp | Date and time when aggregation was performed |
| Sim | Simulation number. Only present in the cohorts file. |
| Dose | Only present if pivoted |
