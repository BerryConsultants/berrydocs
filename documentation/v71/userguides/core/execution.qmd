# Accrual

The Accrual sub-tab provides an interface for specifying accrual profiles. Accrual profiles define the mean recruitment rate week by week during the course of the trial. Virtual subjects are simulated from a Poisson process in which the expected number of subjects per week is allowed to change week by week.

Accrual profiles are shown as a list on the left of the screen, as depicted below. These accrual profiles may be renamed by double-clicking on them and typing a new profile name. After creating a profile, the user must create at least one recruitment region. Early in the trial design process, detailed simulation of the expected accrual pattern is typically not necessary and a single region with a simple mean accrual rate is sufficient.

To model the expected accrual rates more precisely over the course of the trial, the user may specify multiple regions for each accrual profile and
separately parameterize them. Regions are added via the table in the
center of the screen (Figure 7‑1). Within this table, the user may
modify:

-   the peak mean weekly recruitment rate,

-   the start date (in weeks from the start of the trial) for this
    recruitment region,

-   whether the region will have a ramp up phase and if so when the ramp
    up will be complete (in weeks from the start of the trial).

-   Whether the region will have a ramp down, and if so when the ramp
    down start and when the ramp down will complete (in weeks from the
    start of the trial).

Ramp up/ramp down define simple linear increase/decreases in mean
recruitment rate from the start to the end of the ramp. Note that
simulation of accrual is probabilistic, but ramp downs are defined in
terms of time, so even if ramp downs are planned so that at the average
accrual rate they will occur as the trial reaches cap, there is a risk
in simulations when accrual has been slower than average, that ramp
downs occur before the full sample size is reached. It is advisable to
have at least one region that doesn’t ramp down to prevent simulations
being unable to complete.

A graph of the recruitment rate of the highlighted region is shown as
well. As the recruitment parameters are changed, the graph will update
to show the time at which full accrual is reached. An accrual profile
that does not reach full accrual is invalid and cannot be used to run
simulations.

In the screenshot above you can see the two step ramp up in accrual from
two regions – each starting at different offsets into the trial.

Note that the accrual profile graph is only the mean expectation; actual
accrual is simulated using exponential distributions for the intervals
between subjects, derived from the mean accrual profile specified here.
Thus some simulated trials will recruit more quickly than this and some
more slowly.

There are commands to import and export region details from/to simple
external XML files. When importing, the regions defined in the external
file are **added** to the regions already defined, they don’t replace
them.

This is an example of a very simple region file defining just one
region:

```{verbatim}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<regions>
<region>
<name>Region 1</name>
<rate>5</rate>
<start>0</start>
<ramp-up />
<ramp-down />
</region>
</regions>
```
## Deterministic Accrual

If “Deterministic” accrual has been specified on the Study &gt; Study
Info tab, then on the Accrual tab, rather that specifying an accrual
profile from which subject recruitment times are simulated, the user
loads a file of specific accrual dates for every subject.

style="width:5.00179in;height:3.85875in" />

The user specifies a “.dat” file to load that contains the [subject
accrual dates in weeks](## "This value is in weeks from FACTS 7.0 onwards, previously it was in days.") from the start of the trial.

The required file format is a text file with comma separate values. One
row per subject, with 3 fields on each row:

1.  the subject ID, (an integer)

2.  the ID of the region where the subject was recruited (an integer)

3.  and the subjects randomization date (in weeks from the start of the
    trial – this is a ‘real’ number allowing fractions of a week to be
    specified)

The file must contain sufficient entries to allow the maximum number of
subjects specified on the Study > Study Info tab to be recruited.

After successfully loading a file, the FACTS GUI shows a plot of the
resulting weekly accrual rate

# Drop-out Rates

For the continuous and dichotomous engines, and the multiple endpoint
engine, the default dropout scenario is that no subjects drop out of the
study before observing their final endpoint data. If dropouts are
expected, the user can specify either the “Dropouts per Dose,” or
“Dropouts per Dose per Visit.”

If “Dropouts per Dose” is selected, then each subject has a probability
of not having an observable final endpoint value equal to the dropout
rate of the dose that subject is randomized to. If each subject has
multiple visits and “Dropouts per Dose” is selected, then the
conditional probability of dropping out before each visit given that the
subject had not dropped out up to the visit before rates are all equal.
In other words, if the total dropout rate is $\pi_D$, the
probability of dropping out between visits $i$ and $i+1$ given that
the subject had not dropped out at visit $i$ is
$1 - \left( 1 - \pi_{D} \right)^{\frac{1}{V}}$ where $V$ is the total
number of visits.

If “Dropouts per Dose per Visit” is selected, then each subject has a
user specified probability of dropping out before a visit $v$ that is
specified as the conditional probability of dropping out before visit
$v$ given that that they had not dropped out by visit $v-1$. This
leads to a total dropout rate $\pi_D$ for a participant that
is equal to:

$$\pi_{D} = 1 - \prod_{v = 0}^{V}{(1 - \pi_{v})}$$
