# Graphs of Simulation Results

To enable swift visualization and analysis of the simulation results,
FACTS has a number of pre-defined graphs it can display. Full and
detailed simulation results are available in 'csv' format files that can
be loaded into other analysis tools allowing any aspect of the
simulation to be explored. These files are described [below](#output-files).

The graphs in the multiple endpoint engine are largely the same as the
graphs in the single endpoint engine, except that the graphs from the
single endpoint core engines that show responses for an endpoint now have
a control allowing for the selection of which endpoint the plot should
be made for.

This page will attempt to highlight differences between the single endpoint
and the multiple endpoint engines, largely focusing on plots that do not
exist in the single endpoint output. See [Continuous/Dichotomous Simulation Output](./contanddichot.qmd#graphs-of-simulation-results) for full details about the single endpoint graphs in FACTS.

## Per Scenario Graphs

Many of the multiple endpoint graphs are repeated from single endpoint,
potentially with the ability to view for any of the simulated endpoints. When
the endpoint to use can be selected in the controls for a plot, it is common
that the utility can also be selected instead of an endpoint. This will allow
for assessment of the distribution of the combined utility in addition to the
response estimates for the individual endpoints. The repeated graphs are listed
here:

### Utility and Subjects Allocation

![Utility and Subject Allocation.](../coreUGattachments/multendpt/media/image51.png){#fig-51me}

This graph displays a histogram of the mean subject allocation and a
line graph of the mean estimated utility. These plots show:

-   The blue bars show the mean number of subjects allocated to each arm
    over the simulations.

-   The green dashed line is the average of the mean estimate of utility
    over the simulations

-   The black line is the true utility of the combination of the
    underlying response profiles being simulated for all the endpoints.

-   The green vertical lines around the green dashed line shows the
    range of the central 95% of mean estimates of utility over the
    simulations.

### Estimated utility and Target Selection graphs

  ![Utility and Ppn Greatest Pr(UMin absolute: Delta=0.5)](../coreUGattachments/multendpt/media/image53.png){#fig-53me}

:::

These plots show the utility of the true simulated response profiles and
the mean and 95% spread of the mean estimate of utility ratios along
with bars showing the proportion of simulations the different treatment
arms are the finally selected target:

-   The dose with the maximum utility (left)

-   The Minimum Acceptable Utility Dose (Umin), the dose most likely to
    be the minimum dose that exceeds the Clinically Significant Minimum
    Utility (CSMU) of 0.5 (right)

### Utility Boxplot

This box and whisker plot shows the distribution of the estimate of
utility for each dose:

![Utility Boxplot](../coreUGattachments/multendpt/media/image65.png){#fig-65me}

### Per Sim: Utility and Subject Allocation

This set of graphs show the final utility analysis at the end of
individual simulations.

![Estimated Utility for all endpoints and overall, as well as the number of subjects allocated to each arm.](../coreUGattachments/multendpt/media/image72.png){#fig-72me}

These graphs includes a control that allows the user to select
which simulation to graph the results from.

On each graph

-   The black line shows the 'True' overall utility of the response
    profiles being simulated.

-   The green solid line shows the estimate of overall utility

-   The green dashed lines show the boundaries of the 95% credible
    interval for the estimate of utility.

-   The additional lines (here khaki, blue and brown) show the estimates
    of utility of the individual endpoints.

-   The blue bars show the number of subjects finally allocated to each
    arm.

### Per Sim: Utility and QOI

This set of graphs show the final utility analysis at the end of
individual simulations. This is the graph that's shown when the Endpoint
control is chosen to be "Utility" in the "Per Sim: Utility/Response Dist"
plotting controls.

![Estimated Utility for all endpoints and overall, as well as the estimate of a chosen QOI](../coreUGattachments/multendpt/media/image73.png){#fig-73me}

On each graph

-   The black line shows the 'True' overall utility of the response
    profiles being simulated.

-   The green solid line shows the estimate of overall utility

-   The green dashed lines show the boundaries of the 95% credible
    interval for the estimate of utility.

-   The additional lines (here khaki, blue and brown) show the estimates
    of utility of the individual endpoints.

-   The blue bars show the final values of a selected Utility QOI.

### Per interim: Utility Alloc, Utility Dist

This is an identical set of graphs to the [Per Sim: Utility and Subject Allocation](#per-sim-utility-and-subject-allocation) and [Per Sim: Utility and QOI](#per-sim-utility-and-qoi) plots, except that in addition to the control to select which simulation to
graph the results from, there is a control to select which interim
within the simulation to graph the results from. These graphs are only
available for those simulations for which 'weeks' files have been output
(by default the first 100).
number of files to be read and subsequent processing of the data.

## Across Scenario Graphs

The Across Scenario graphs for the multiple endpoint engine are the same as the
graphs available in the individual continuous and dichotomous engines.

For reference, these are:

-   [Selected Arms](./contanddichot.qmd#selected-arms)

-   [QOI Box Plots](./contanddichot.qmd#qoi-box-plots)

-   [Ppn Success](./contanddichot.qmd#ppn-success)

-   [Response/Utility](./contanddichot.qmd#response)

-   [Allocation](./contanddichot.qmd#allocation)

-   [Interim vs Final Scatter Plot](./contanddichot.qmd#interim-vs-final-scatter-plot)

-   [Receiver Operating Characteristics](./contanddichot.qmd#receiver-operating-characteristics)

The only differences from the single endpoint across scenario graphs are:

-   QOI Box Plots graph now has Utility as a selectable endpoint and the utility QOIs are available to be plotted

-   Respnnse/Utility is the same as the single endpoint Response graph, except that Utility is a selectable endpoint

-   Interim vs Final Scatter Plot now has utility QOIs

-   Receiver Operating Characteristics plots now have utility QOIs.

# Viewing Simulation Results in the Simulations Tab

After simulations have been run, FACTS provides a table for assessing
the output from the simulations. While everything that FACTS displays in
the table on the Simulation tab is available in output files, FACTS does
a substantial amount of "beautifying" of results in its built-in table.
This entails changes like converting numeric outcome scores to readable text and
using descriptive names for QOI columns.

The main table has 1 line per scenario, and
shows the summary of all simulations run for each scenario. These lines
show values that are stored in the summary.csv file.

More detailed simulation output, providing a row per simulation run, is
accessibile by double clicking on any row of the output table. This row-per-simulation
output is what is stored in the simulations.csv files.

Additional detail is available for simulations that have a weeks file by right
clicking on a simulation in the simulation summary window and selecting
"Weeks Results". See the Results Output section of the Simulation tab to
specify the number of weeks files to be output.

## Summary per Scenario

By default, only a subset of all columns of output are provided when simulations are
complete. This set of columns is called "Highlights." To get access to further
columns, you can right click anywhere on the simulation output table and click
"Summary Results: ...." for whichever set of columns you would like to see. There
is a "Summary Results: All" option that will provide a pop up containing every
column available for summary results.

The following sections break down which columns are available by sorting to
which column subset.

### Highlights

These are the columns displayed on the simulations tab after simulations are completed, the can also be displayed in the separate "Highlights" results window.

So the sum of each Ppn(target) QOI across the doses should sum to between 0 and 1 inclusive.                                                                                     |

: The columns available when selecting Frequentist results for a specific endpoint and missingness handling method.

## Detailed Per Simulation Results

After simulation has completed and simulation results have been loaded, the user may examine detailed results for any scenario with simulations output in the table by double-clicking on the appropriate row. A separate window pops up and displays the results for each individual simulation. This is a "prettier" view of the contents of the "simulations.csv" file, which is described below. The simulations results are partitioned into the same results groupings as the summary results. These can be accessed from the "right click" menu, along with opening the results folder, opening the weeks file for a particular simulation and opening the simulated patients file for a particular simulation (where a "weeks" file or a "patients" file has been output).

# Output Files

Instead of viewing simulation output on the Simulation tab within FACTS, the output is all contained within easily accessible files saved the the user's local machine. FACTS stores the results of simulations as '.csv' files under a Results folder. For each row in the simulations table, there is a folder named by the profiles that make up the scenario, which contains the corresponding '.csv' files.

![The windows file explorer when opened to the directory containing simulation output.](../coreUGattachments/multendpt/media/image102.png){#fig-windowsexplorerme}

These files can be opened using Microsoft Excel, but versions of Excel before 2007 are restricted to 256 columns, which is too few to view some files in their entirety. The 'Calc' application in 'OpenOffice' will show all the columns (and will open two files that have the same name at the same time!). Because Excel takes out a file lock on any file it has open, while a file is open in Excel it cannot be deleted or modified by another application. The most common cause for an error to be reported when simulating trials in FACTS is because the user has one of the previous results files is still open in Excel.

In the scenario directory there are the following types of results file:

**Summary.csv** Contains a single row of data that summarizes the simulation results. This is the source of the shown on the simulations tab.

[ **Summary_freq_bocf\_\<endpoint\>.csv,** ]{.custom-tooltip}[Continuous only.]{.tooltip-text} **Summary_freq_locf\_\<endpoint\>.csv,** **Summary_freq_ignore\_\<endpoint\>.csv,** [ **Summary_freq_fail\_\<endpoint\>.csv,** ]{.custom-tooltip}[Dichotomous only.]{.tooltip-text} Contains a single row of data that summarizes the frequentist results. A file is output for each endpoint for which frequentist analysis is enabled, and for each of the different method for dealing with missing data that are selected on the Frequentist Analysis tab: BOCF if the endpoint is continuous and the baseline score is being simulated, "fail" for dichotomous, LOCF and "ignore" (referred to as PP (Per-Protocol) in the GUI).

**Simulations.csv** Contains one row per simulation describing the final state of each simulation for every trial simulated.

[ **Simulations_freq_bocf\_\<endpoint\>.csv,** ]{.custom-tooltip}[Continuous only.]{.tooltip-text} **Simulations_freq_locf\_\<endpoint\>.csv,** **Simulations_freq_ignore\_\<endpoint\>.csv,** [ **Simulations_freq_fail\_\<endpoint\>.csv,** ]{.custom-tooltip}[Dichotomous only.]{.tooltip-text} Contains one row per simulation describing the final frequentist analysis of each simulation for every trial simulated. A file is output for each endpoint for which frequentist analysis is enabled, and for each of the different methods for dealing with missing data that are applicable

**PatientsNNNNN.csv** Contains one row per patient in a simulation, where NNNNN is the number of the simulation. By default this file is written out only for the first simulation, but this can be changed on the simulations tab.

**WeeksNNNNN.csv** Contains one row for each cohort during a simulation where NNN is the number of the simulation. By default this file is written only for the first 100 simulations, but this can be changed via the simulation tab. The values in the last row of the cohorts file will be the same as the final values for that simulation in the simulations file.

<span class="custom-tooltip"> \*\*weeks_freq_bocf\_\<endpoint\>\_NNNNN.csv,\*\* [Continuous only.]{.tooltip-text} </span> \*\*weeks_freq_locf\_\<endpoint\>\_NNNN.csv,\*\* \*\*weeks_freq_ignore\_\<endpoint\>\_NNNN.csv,\*\* <span class="custom-tooltip"> \*\*weeks_freq_fail\_\<endpoint\>\_NNNNN.csv,\*\* [Dichotomous only.]{.tooltip-text} </span> Contains one row for each interim during a simulation where NNNNN is the number of the simulation. A file is output for each endpoint for which frequentist analysis is enabled, for each simulation for which a frequentist “weeks file” is to be output, and for each of the different methods for dealing with missing data that are applicable.

## Contents of summary.csv

The first two lines are header lines, starting with a '\#', containing the column headings. The first line contains the lengthy "human readable" form of the QOI names, the second line contains the shorter "computer readable" alternate QOI names. For columns that are not QOI values, the column names are the same in the two rows.

### QOI Columns

The QOI columns depend on the QOIs that have been defined for this
design. The columns in the following order:

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Posterior Probabilities | The summary file contains the mean (over the simulations) of the posterior probability for each dose. |
| Predictive Probabilities | The summary file contains the mean (over the simulations) of the predictive probability for each dose. |
| P-Values | The summary file contains the mean (over the simulations) of the p-value for each dose. |
| Target Probabilities | The summary file contains the proportion of times (over the simulations) each dose had the greatest probability of being the target. |
| Decision QOIs | The summary file contains the mean (over the simulations) of the final value of the decision QOI at the target. |

## Contents of Summary_freq_{missingnessType}.csv

There is a frequentist summary file for each type of treatment of
missing values.

The first line is a header line, starting with a '#', containing the
FACTS GUI version number, the name of the FACTS file, the name of the
scenario, and the time stamp of the start of the simulation.

The second line is a header line, starting with a '#', containing the following
column headings.

## Contents of simulations.csv and weeksNNNNN.csv

The simulations.csv file holds the FACTS summary of the final analysis
for each simulation (one per row).

The weeksNNNNN.csv file holds the FACTS summary of every analysis for
the NNNNN^th^ simulation. It contains a row for each interim in the
trial and a row for the final analysis (Interim number 999).

The final analysis occurs after all the planned data is collected. If the
trial does not stop early, the final analysis occurs after full follow-up
for all subjects. If the trial does stop early at an interim analysis, then
the timing of the final analysis depends on the status of the check boxes
on the [Interims tab](../design/interims.qmd#subject-follow-up-options). If
follow-up is collected after the particular interim decision, then an analysis
after full follow-up of the subjects recruited up to the point of the
interim when the stopping decision was taken. If there is no follow-up
intended after the interim analysis decision, then the final analysis occurs immediately (at the same time as the interim analysis), and the final analysis criteria are checked.

The first line is a header line, starting with a '#', containing the
FACTS GUI version number, the name of the FACTS file, the name of the
scenario, and the time stamp of the start of the simulation.

The second line is a header line, starting with a '#', containing the following
column headings.

Most of the columns are common to the two file types, but the weeks file
does not contain columns for the 'final' values of the evaluation
criteria.

### QOI Columns

The QOI columns depend on the QOIs that have been defined for this
design. The columns are grouped in the following order:

| QOI Type | Description |
|------|----------------|
| Posterior Probabilities | The posterior probability for each QOI for each dose. |
| Predictive Probabilities | The predictive probability for each QOI for each dose. |
| P-Values | The p-value for each QOI for each dose. |
| Target Probabilities | The probability of being the target for each QOI for each dose. |
| Decision QOIs | The value of the decision QOI at the target. |
| Success Futile | A flag for each QOI decision criteria indicating if the decision QOI was evaluated and compared to a threshold at the interim (weeks file) or final analysis (simulation file). The flag value is -1 if the decision QOI was not evaluated, 0 if it did not meet the threshold and 1 if it did. |
| Success / Futile Combined | Flags indicating if the interim or final analysis determined success or futility taking all the factors defined for Success/Futility into account: 0 if the conditions were not met, 1 it the conditions were met. If success and futility conditions have been defined that are not mutually exclusive and both sets of combined conditions are met, FACTS will pick one of the outcomes as met but not the other. In order to discourage defining Success and Futility rules that can both be true FACTS does not guarantee which outcome will be selected. |

## Contents of Simulations_freq_{missingnessType}.csv, Weeks_freq_{missingnessType}.csv

## Contents of MCMCNNNNN.csv

The MCMC file if requested for output by the user, contains all the MCMC
samples for the fitted parameters in the design. There is one row per
sample (including the burnin) and the samples from all the analyses in
the simulation are included. The first two columns are the analysis
index and the sample (within analysis) index. The remaining columns are
the parameters whose sample values are being reported, the number and
constituents of these columns are highly variable depending on design of
the statistical analysis.

| Longmod <model> <param> <visit> | L\*P\*V | Currently the values of Alpha0, Alpha1, AlphaS (the parameters to the Dirichlet distribution) are (unnecessarily – these values are not sampled) output, along with the values for P0, P1 and PS the transition probabilities of each model at each visit. |
