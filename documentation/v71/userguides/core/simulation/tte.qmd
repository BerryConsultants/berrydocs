# Graphs of Simulation Results

To enable swift visualization and analysis of the simulation results,
FACTS has a number of pre-defined graphs it can display. Full and
detailed simulation results are available in 'csv' format files that can
be loaded into other analysis tools allowing any aspect of the
simulation to be explored. These files are described in Section 16,
below.

To view the graphs of the results of the simulations of a particular
design variant in a particular scenario, select a row of scenario
results by clicking on it and then click on the 'View Graph' button and
select "Show Per Scenario Graphs".

To view graphs showing the results of the simulations of
possibly all the design variants and all the scenarios click on the
'View Graph' button and select "Show Across Scenario Graphs". This
launches a graph display that displays multiple graphs in a trellis
plot.

![Select the scenarios to include in Across Scenario graphs.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image51.png){#fig-acrossscentte}

The graph display supports copying an image of the graph to the
clipboard, to facilitate pasting them into documents and presentations.
Right clicking on a graph brings up a short menu that allows the image
of the graph to be copied to the clipboard or saved in '.png' format to
a file.

Many graphs have a number of controls to allow the graph to be tailored,
standard graph controls available on most graphs are:

-   Set Y axis -- this displays a dialog boxing allowing the user to fix
    the minimum and maximum of each of the Y axes and the number of
    'tick' marks. (Not displayed if the 'y' value must lie in the
    interval 0-1.

-   Space doses evenly -- if the x-value is 'dose', then data for each
    dose can either be spaced equally or proportionate to the doses'
    effective dose strength.

#### Box and whisker plot conventions

-   The mean probability is plotted as a large dot.

-   The median value is plotted as a dashed line.

-   The 25-75^th^ quantile range is plotted as the "box" portion of each
    point.

-   The "whiskers" extend to the largest and smallest values within 1 Â½
    times the interquartile range from either end of the box.

-   Points outside the whisker range are considered outliers, and are
    plotted as small blue dots. Note that it may be difficult to see all
    of these symbols if they are plotted at the same value.

# Per Scenario Graphs

## Allocation Box and Whisker Plot

![Distribution of Subject Allocation Across Simulations.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image52.png){#fig-52t}

This graph displays a box and whisker plot of the number of subjects
recruited into each arm. These plots show:

-   The distribution over all simulations of the number of subjects
    allocated to each arm shown as a box and whisker plot. If the design
    is not adaptive, the number allocated will be the same in every
    simulation and the box and whiskers collapse to a single line.

-   The mean number of events observed in each arm across the
    simulations shown as a red triangle.

## Events Boxplot

![Distribution of Number of Events Across Simulations](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image53.png){#fig-numEvents}

This graph displays a box and whisker plot of the number of events
observed in each arm. These plots show:

-   The distribution over all simulations of the number of events
    observed in each arm shown as a box and whisker plot.

## Hazard Ratio and Subject Allocation

![Hazard Ratio and Subject Allocation](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image54.png){#fig-hrsubjalloc}

This graph shows for each treatment arm, the mean subject allocation,
mean number of events observed and the mean estimated hazard ratio.
Specifically:

-   The blue bars show the mean number of subjects without events and
    the brown bars mean number of subjects who had events.

-   The black line shows the true Hazard Ratio being simulated (but
    without allowing for any effect of the predictor)

-   The green dashed line (drawn if a response model is fitted), shows
    the mean of the estimated hazard ratios across the simulations

-   The green 'error bars' show the spread of the central 95% of the
    estimated hazard ratios (if less than 20 simulations have been run
    it simply shows the full spread).

## Hazard Ratio and Target Selection graphs

![Hazard Ratio and [$Pr$(MED relative to Control: Delta=-0.2)]{.fake-code-block} Selection](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image55.png){#fig-hrtargetsel}

These plots show the true simulated hazard ratio (without allowance for
the effect of the predictor) and the mean and 95% spread of the mean
fitted hazard ratios along with bars showing the proportion of
simulations the different treatment arms are the finally selected
target. The target displayed is selected by a control on the graph, from
any of the defined Target QOIs.:

## Predictor: Response and Allocation

![Predictor Hazard Ratio and Subject Allocation](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image56.png){#fig-predhrsubjAlloc}

These plots show the true simulated predictor response and the mean and
95% spread of the mean fitted predictor response model, with the blue
bars showing the mean number of subjects allocated to each arm across
the simulations.

## Per Dose: QOIs

![Distribution of [P(Succ. Future Trial: N=250; Sup. $\alpha=0.025$, $\delta=0$ Adjusted Significance)]{.fake-code-block} Across Simulations](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image57.png){#fig-perdoseQOI}

These plots show a box plot showing the distribution of the values for
any of the defined QOIs for each dose.

Which QOI is displayed can be selected by the user from a drop down list
on the graph. Any of the Posterior Probability, Predictive Probability,
P-value and Target QOI's can be selected.

## Target Hazard Ratio Scatter Plot

![Posterior Mean Hazard Ratio at [Pr(Max)]{.fake-code-block} vs Total Sample Size per Simulation Run](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image58.png){#fig-meanHRSS}

This graph shows a scatter plot of trial outcomes with the estimate
hazard ratio as the y-axis and total number of subjects recruited as the
x-axis. A drop down list on the graph allows the user to select which
target QOI is used to supply the hazard ratio:

The trials are plotted with a symbol that indicated the final outcome:

-   A light blue circle indicates a trial that stopped early for success

-   A dark blue circle indicates a trial that was a late success

-   A dark red square indicates a trial that was a late futility

-   A light red square indicates a trial that stopped early for futility

-   A light pink diamond indicates a trial that stopped early for
    success but where the final analysis was futility

-   A dark pink diamond indicates a trial that stopped early for
    futility but where the final analysis was success

-   A yellow cross indicates a trial that completed full enrolment but
    was inconclusive at the end.

These graphs are not particularly useful if there is no early stopping.

If the design does allow early stopping this graph shows

-   The overall distribution of sample sizes -- in particular is
    stopping evenly distributed from the moment stopping is possible, or
    is there are large cohort of trials that stop as soon as its
    possible?

-   When and with what response rate trials stop incorrectly, in
    particular having trials stopping and the decision being reversed
    suggests stopping is allowed to soon or the criteria is not
    conservative enough.

There are two further variants of this graph, these have alternative
y-axes: the hazard ratio at the EDx or at the MED.

## Cumulative Operating Characteristics Plot

:::{#fig-cpdursubj layout-ncol=2}

![Cumulative Proportion of Duration](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image59.png){#fig-cpdur}

![Cumulative Proportion of Subjects](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image60.png){#fig-cpsubj}

:::

There are two graphs, one that shows the cumulative proportion of
durations across all simulations, and the other shows the cumulative
proportion of subjects across all simulations.

## Time course for stopping

There are two graphs, one that shows the distribution over time for
stopping for futility and one for stopping for success.

:::{#fig-cpsuccfutil layout-ncol=2}

![Cumulative Proportion of Futility Over Time](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image61.png){#fig-cpfutil}

![Cumulative Proportion of Success Over Time](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image62.png){#fig-cpsuccess}

:::

These plots show as cumulative curves the proportion of the simulations
that stopped at different time points from the start of the trial.

The x-axis is configurable, the user can select cumulative stopping to
be plotted relative to time, sample size or number of events observed.

## Arm Dropping Graphs

If the design has used arm dropping, the following graphs are available.

### Hazard ratio and Ppn Arms Dropped

![Hazard Ratio and Proportion Arm Dropped](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image63.png){#fig-hrarmdrop}

This graph shows the true (simulated) mean response and the average
fitted response with 2.5% & 97.5% quantiles.

The histogram bars show for each arm the proportion of simulations for
which the arm was dropped.

### Time Course for Arm Dropping

This graph shows, for each arm, the cumulative proportion of simulations
when it was dropped. The user can select whether time or number of
subjects allocated to the arm is used as the x-axis.

![Cumulative Proportion of Trials where Arm Dropped](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image64.png){#fig-cparmdropped}

### Time Course for Arm retention

This graph shows, for each arm, the cumulative proportion of simulations
when the arm was retained. The user can select whether time or number of
subjects allocated to the arm is used as the x-axis. This is simply the
inverse of the arm dropping graph above.

![Cumulative Proportion of Trials Where Arm Retained](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image65.png){#fig-cparmretained}

### Arm Retention Proportion

This graph shows, for each arm, the simple proportion of simulations
where the arm was retained.

![Arm Retention Proportion](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image66.png){#fig-armretprop}

## Frequentist

These graphs are available if frequentist analysis is enabled.

### Frequentist P(significance)

These graphs are the box and whisker plots of various p-values that are
automatically calculated (that is to say they do not need to be defined
as QOIs for them to be calculated) for the final analysis. The user can
select from Unadjusted, Bonferroni and Dunnett\'s and LOCF, BOCF (if
baseline is simulated) or PP (per-protocol) treatment of missing values.

![Distribution of [$P$(Log Rand Adjusted Significance)]{.fake-code-block} Across Simulations](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image67.png){#fig-pvaldist}

### Frequentist: Response and Significance

This graph plots the mean and 2.5-97.5 percentile of the mean across the
simulations or the simple frequentist estimate of the response for each
arm, along with a histogram plot of the ppn of times the response on
each arm was significant. The user can select from the Unadjusted,
Bonferroni or Log Rank, Log Rank Bonferroni, Wilcox and Wilcox
Bonferroni p-values.

![Hazard Ratio and Ppn Log Rank Significance](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image68.png){#fig-respsig}

## Per Sim Graphs

This set of graphs includes a control that allows the user to select
which simulation to graph the results from. Each graph shows the output from
only 1 simulated trial.

![The plot window when selecting a Per Sim graph. Note the Simulation control in the bottom left allowing for the selection of which simulated trial the graph should be made for.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image70.png){#fig-persimcontrol}

### Hazard Ratio and Subject Allocation

This graph shows the final analysis at the end of individual
simulations.

![Hazard Ratio and Subject Allocation](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image69.png){#fig-persimhrsubjalloc}

 On each graph

-   The black line shows the 'True' Hazard Ratio being simulated, (not
    adjusted to include any predictor effects)

-   The blue bars show the mean number of subjects without events and
    the brown bars mean number of subjects who had events.

-   If a response model has been fitted:

    -   The green solid line shows the estimate of the mean hazard ratio

    -   The green dashed lines show the boundaries of the 95% credible
        interval for the estimate of the hazard ratio.

-   Otherwise if the Independent Dose model has been fitted:

    -   The light green circle shows the mean estimate of the hazard
        ratio for each arm

    -   The vertical green arms show the extent of the 95% credible
        interval for the estimate of the hazard ratio for each arm.


### Posterior Quantities

This graph shows the final analysis at the end of individual
simulations, including the distribution of a selected QOI.

![Hazard Ratio and [$Pr$($HR_d$ - 1 < -0.2)]{.fake-code-block} Probability](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image71.png){#fig-persimpostquant}

This graph includes a control that allows the user to select which
simulation to graph the results from and which QOI to plot. On each
graph

-   The black line shows the 'True' mean response being simulated.

-   The brown circles and arms show the mean raw data and its 95% CI for
    each arm.

-   If a response model has been fitted:

    -   The green solid line shows the estimate of the mean hazard ratio

    -   The green dashed lines show the boundaries of the 95% credible
        interval for the estimate of the hazard ratio.

-   Otherwise if the Independent Dose model has been fitted:

    -   The light green circle shows the mean estimate of the hazard
        ratio for each arm

    -   The vertical green arms show the extent of the 95% credible
        interval for the estimate of the hazard ratio for each arm.

-   Brown bars showing the final value of the selected QOI for each arm
    at the end of the simulated trial.

The user can select from any of the Posterior Probability, Predictive
Probability or Target Probability QOIs to plot, including QOI's based on
the predictor.

### Predictor Response and Allocation

![Predictor Hazard Ratio and Subject Allocation (Week: 80)](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image72.png){#fig-persimpredhrsubjalloc}

If the simulations include a predictor this graph is available.

This graph includes a control that allows the user to select which
simulation to graph the results from. On each graph

-   The black line shows the 'True' Predictor response being simulated

-   If a response model has been fitted:

    -   The green solid line shows the estimate of the mean hazard ratio

    -   The green dashed lines show the boundaries of the 95% credible
        interval for the estimate of the hazard ratio.

-   Otherwise if the Independent Dose model has been fitted:

    -   The light green circle shows the mean estimate of the hazard
        ratio for each arm

    -   The vertical green arms show the extent of the 95% credible
        interval for the estimate of the hazard ratio for each arm.

-   Blue Bars showing number of subjects allocated to each treatment
    arm.

## Per Interim Graphs

This is an identical set of graphs to the Per Sim graphs, the difference
is that in addition to a control to select which simulation to graph the
results from, there is a control to select which interim within the
simulation to graph the results from. These graphs are only available
for those simulations for which 'weeks' files have been output (by
default the first 100). Note the control in the bottom left that allows
for specification of Simulation number as well as Interim number.

![The plot window when selecting a Per Interim graph. Note the Simulation control in the bottom left allowing for the selection of which simulated trial and which interim analysis the graph should be made for.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image73.png){#fig-perintpostquant}

## Post Simulation Boundary Finding Graphs

### Explore Success/Futility Eval Criteria

<!-- :::{#fig-exploreSuccFutil layout-ncol=2}

![Proportion of Simulations that would be futile by futility threshold.](){#fig-exploreFutil}

![Proportion of Simulations that would be successful by success threshold.](){#fig-exploreSuccess}

::: -->

These graphs can be used to explore what proportion of simulated trials
of a particular scenario would have been a success/failure at final
evaluation. Using the two drop down controls the user can select the
target dose to use: Max, EDx or MED, and set and lower/upper limits to
explore for the threshold (setting the range used on the x-axis).

For the given target the proportion of trials that would meet each of
the criteria over the range of threshold values is plotted. As in the
examples above, the plots will be somewhat jagged if only a small number
of simulations have been run. These graphs can be used to select
thresholds that can be expected to yield a certain level of type-1 or
power, but the user must remember these will only be approximate
(depending on the number of simulations) but can be useful to understand
the designs sensitivity to the thresholds and to set initial thresholds
early on in the design / simulation process that will get close to the
desired type-1 error and power from the outset.

### Explore Early Success/Futility Eval Criteria

:::{#fig-cpsuccfutilearly layout-ncol=2}

![Cumulative Proportion of Simulations Satisfying Futility Criterion by Interim](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image74.png){#fig-cpfutilearly}

![Cumulative Proportion of Simulations Satisfying Success Criterion by Interim](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image75.png){#fig-cpsuccessearly}

:::

These graphs can be used to explore what proportion of simulated trials
of a particular scenario would have stopped early for success/futility.
NOTE these graphs require weeks files to have been output, they are also
most use where the design has been simulated with interims but no early
stopping (as in the examples above where the shape of the "existing
stopping rules" line indicates that no early stopping occurred in these
simulations).

Using the two drop down controls, the user can select which stopping
criteria is evaluated and from which interim stopping will be permitted.
Lines are then displayed for the proportion of simulations that would
have stopped by each interim for a fixed set of thresholds.

Typically these can be used to see at what threshold (and starting at
what interim) stopping for success or futility introduces an
unacceptably level of 'incorrect' early stopping -- stopping for
futility in successful scenarios and stopping for success in futile
scenarios and whether at below/above these levels there may be a useful
probability of correct stopping.

### Explore Arm Dropping Criteria

![Cumulative Proportion of Simulations Where Selected Arm Satisfies Criterion by Interim](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image76.png){#fig-cpselectedwins}

This graph is similar to the Explore Early Success/Futility Criteria
graph but for arm dropping criteria. The user has an additional control
to select which dose the proportion of trials in which the arm would be
dropped is displayed.

### Success/Futility Stopping Contours

:::{#fig-succfutilcontours layout-ncol=2}

![Proportion of Simulations Reaching Futility for Early/Late Criterion Thresholds](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image77.png){#fig-futilcontours}
![Proportion of Simulations Reaching Success for Early/Late Criterion Thresholds](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image78.png){#fig-succcontours}

:::

These graphs allow early stopping and final evaluation criteria to be
considered jointly. Like the explore early stopping criteria plots,
these graphs require weeks files to have been output and will work best
if interims were evaluated but no trials actually stopped early.

The user selects the criterion to plot, the first interim at which early
stopping is allowed, and the upper/lower limit of the threshold to
consider.

FACTS will then plot contours where (final evaluation threshold, early
stopping threshold) yield the same proportion of trials that are a
success/futile. Contours are only plotted where final evaluation
threshold \< early stopping threshold for success and vice versa for
futility. Early stopping criteria should not be less strict than final
criteria.

Again the example graphs shown are based on only 100 simulations with
weeks files, so any threshold derived will only very approximately yield
these success/futility rates.

# Across Scenario Graphs

## Selected Arms

This graph shows a bar chart for each scenario and variant selected.
Each chart shows how often each arm was 'selected' by the target QOI
specified on the Study \> Variants tab. Each bar uses a stacked bar to
show the proportion of times that arm was:

-   "Successful" --the arm was correctly selected (marked as "Should
    succeed" on the VSR tab) and the trial was successful.

-   "Should not succeed" -- the arm was incorrectly selected (not marked
    as "Should succeed" on the VSR tab) and the trial was successful.

-   Unsuccessful -- the arm was selected and the trial failed.

![Across scenario graph for selected arms with 4 scenarios and 3 design variants.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image79.png){#fig-79t}

## QOI Box Plots

This graph shows a box and whisker plot for each scenario and variant
selected. Each plot shows the distribution of the values of a selected
QOI for each arm. There is a drop down control to allow the selection of
the QOI to be displayed. Any Posterior probability, Predictive
probability, p-value or target QOI can be selected.

![Across scenario graph showing QOIs per arm with 4 scenarios and 3 design variants.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image80.png){#fig-80t}

## Ppn Success

This grouped bar chart shows a bar for the proportion of successful
simulations for each variant, grouped by scenario.

![Across scenario graph for showing the proportion of trials that result in success with 4 scenarios and 3 design variants.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image81.png){#fig-81t}

## Response

This graph shows a dose response plot for each scenario and variant
selected. Each plot shows the mean estimate over the simulations and the
95%-ile interval of the mean estimates over the simulations. The graph
also shoes the "true response" i.e. the mean response being simulated.

![Across scenario graph for showing the average estimated dose response model vs. the true dose responses with 4 scenarios and 3 design variants.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image82.png){#fig-82t}

## Allocation

This graph shows a box and whisker plot for each scenario and variant
selected. Each plot shows the distribution of the number of subjects
allocated to each arm over the simulations.

![Across scenario graph for showing the distribution of allocation per arm with 4 scenarios and 3 design variants.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image83.png){#fig-83t}

## Sample Size

This graph shows the mean sample size for each scenario at different
maximum sample sizes (the different variants).

![Across scenario graph for showing the mean sample size of the study with 4 scenarios and 3 design variants.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image84.png){#fig-84t}

## Interim vs Final Scatter Plot

This is an interactive plot that shows the outcome of each simulation
over all the scenarios of a selected variant.

The x-axis shows the value of the selected decision QOI at the specified
interim, and the y-axis shows the final value of a (possibly different)
selected decision QOI. As well as selecting a decision QOI for the final
decision, the graph can use the actual final decision in the simulations
-- the value of the QOI used in the first criteria is used for the
decision is used for the y-axis.

Note the graph is based just on the values at the selected interim, what
might happen at other interims is ignored.

Thresholds can be set to specify early and late success/futility. Each
scenario is then coloured to show its outcome -- and stacked bar graphs
are displayed to show the proportion of each outcome for each scenario.
The thresholds can be changed and the graph re-drawn. If the selected
QOI uses a p-value the checks for success are that it is "\<" than the
threshold, (and vice-versa for futility), otherwise the checks for
success are that it is "\>" the threshold (and vice-versa for futility).

The graph can only display the results for simulations for which cohorts
files have been output, and for simulations that reached the specified
interim. Thus the graph works best if interims have been specified, but
the simulations run without any early stopping enabled -- so each
simulation has the results for every interim.

With 1,000 simulations per scenario and cohorts files for each
simulation, the graph will take several seconds to re-draw. To allow
several parameters to be set before redrawing (rather than having to
wait for the redraw after each change) the graph is only redrawn after
the 'Redraw' button is clicked.

![Across scenario graph showing an interim QOI plotted against a final analysis QOI with the decision dictating the point color. Additionally, the bars on the right hand side represent the proportion of trials that made each decision based on the decision rules specified in the plot controls.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image85.png){#fig-85t}

## Receiver Operating Characteristics

This graph plots the relative proportion of successful simulations in
the scenarios compared to the proportion of successes in one specific
scenario. The intended use of this is to yield a "Receiver Operating
Characteristics" (ROC) curve. This is done as follows:

-   Select the decision QoI that is to be used to determine final
    success/futility. (The graph only supports the simple case where
    just one is being used).

-   Select a scenario that represents the 'Null' case -- where
    determining success is a type-1 error.

-   If multiple variants have been simulated, select which variant to
    plot.

FACTS computes for the null scenario, for a range of decision threshold
values, what proportion of the 'Null' scenario sims would have been
successful (giving the estimated type-1 error rate), these proportions
form the x-values for each point. The corresponding threshold values are
shown on the x-axis at the top of the graph, the type-1 error rate on
the x-axis at the bottom of the graph.

FACTS then computes for each of the other scenarios in turn the
proportion of sims that would have been successful **and selected a
"should succeed" dose** so it is necessary for doses to have been
specified as "should succeed" on the Virtual Subject Response profiles
(giving the estimate of power for that scenario -- where 'power' also
requires correct dose selection), at each of the threshold values, these
proportions are then shown on the y-axis of the graph.

Thus for each scenario we can see the estimated power of the design to
determine success for a given type-1 error rate in the specified Null
scenario.

![Across scenario graph showing ROC curves of the power of one selected design variant under different scenarios as a function of the type I error in the selected null scenario.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image86.png){#fig-86t}

# Viewing Simulation Results in the Simulations Tab

After simulations have been run, FACTS provides a table for assessing
the output from the simulations. While everything that FACTS displays in
the table on the SImulation tab is available in output files, FACTS does
a substantial amount of "beautifying" of results in its built-in table.
This entails changes like converting numeric outcome scores to readable text and
using descriptive names for QOI columns.

The main table has 1 line per scenario, and
shows the summary of all simulations run for each scenario. These lines
show values that are stored in the summary.csv file.

More detailed simulation output, providing a row per simulation run, is
accessbile by double clicking on any row of the output table. This row-per-simulation
output is what is stored in the simulations.csv files.

Additional detail is available for simulations that have a weeks file by right
clicking on a simulation in the simulation summary window and selecting
"Weeks Results". See the Results Output section of the Simulation tab to
specify the number of weeks files to be output.

## Summary per Scenario

By default, only a subset of all columns of output are provided when simulations are
complete. This set of columns is called "Highlights." To get access to further
columns, you can right click anywhere on the simulation output table and click
"Summary Results: ...." for whichever set of columns you would like to see. There
is a "Summary Results: All" option that will provide a pop up containing every
column available for summary results.

The following sections break down which columns are available by sorting to
which column subset.

### Highlights

These are the columns displayed on the simulations tab after simulations
are completed, the can also be displayed in the separate "Highlights"
results window.

|          |         | is always identifiable, so the Ppn(target) for |
|          |         | these QOIs will sum to 1 across the doses.     |

|          |         | criteria in any MCMC sample so all doses have  |
|          |         | a 0 probability of having a response greater   |
|          |         | than Control (or AC) by the CSD then no dose   |
|          |         | is the MED. So the sum of each Ppn(target) QOI |
|          |         | across the doses should sum to between 0 and 1 |

## Detailed Simulation Results

After simulation has completed and simulation results have been loaded,
the user may examine detailed results for any scenario with simulation
data in the table by double-clicking on the row. A separate window (as
in Figure 15â1) displays the individual results for each simulation.
This is the contents of the "simulations.csv" file, which is described
below.

![The simulation results pop out viewer showing simulation highlights.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image96.png){#fig-simulations}

# Output Files

Instead of viewing simulation output on the Simulation tab within FACTS,
the output is all contained within easily accessible files saved the the
user's local machine. FACTS stores the results of simulations as '.csv'
files under a Results folder. For each row in the simulations table,
there is a folder named by the profiles that make up the scenario, which
contains the corresponding '.csv' files.

![The windows file explorer when opened to the directory containing simulation output.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image97.png){#fig-windowsexplorer}

These files can be opened using Microsoft Excel, but versions of Excel
before 2007 are restricted to 256 columns, which is too few to view some
files in their entirety. The 'Calc' application in 'OpenOffice' will
show all the columns (and will open two files that have the same name at
the same time!). Because Excel takes out a file lock on any file it has
open, while a file is open in Excel it cannot be deleted or modified by
another application. The most common cause for an error to be reported
when simulating trials in FACTS is because the user has one of the
previous results files is still open in Excel.

In the scenario directory there are the following types of results file:

**Summary.csv** Contains a single row of data that summarizes the
simulation results. This is the source of the shown on the simulations
tab.

**Summary_freq.csv** Contains a single row of data that that summarizes
the frequentist analysis of the simulations.

**Simulations.csv** Contains one row per simulation describing the final
state of each simulation for every trial simulated.

**Simulations_freq.csv** Contains one row per simulation describing the
frequentist analysis of the final state of each simulation for every
trial simulated.

**PatientsNNNNN.csv** Contains one row per patient in simulation, where
NNNNN is the number of the simulation. By default this file is written
out only for the first simulation, but this can be changed via the
'Advanced' button on the simulations tab.

**WeeksNNNNN.csv** contains one row for each cohort during a simulation
where NNN is the number of the simulation. By default this file is
written only for the first 100 simulations, but this can be changed via
the advanced button on the simulation tab. The values in the last row of
the cohorts file will be the same as the final values for that
simulation in the simulations file.

## Contents of summary.csv

The first line is a header line, starting with a '#', containing the
FACTS GUI version number, the name of the FACTS file, the name of the
scenario, and the time stamp of the start of the simulation.

The second line is a header line, starting with a '#', containing the following
column headings.

### QOI Columns

The QOI columns depend on the QOIs that have been defined for this
design. The columns in the following order:

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Posterior Probabilities | The summary file contains the mean (over the simulations) of the posterior probability for each dose. |
| Predictive Probabilities | The summary file contains the mean (over the simulations) of the predictive probability for each dose. |
| P-Values | The summary file contains the mean (over the simulations) of the p-value for each dose. |
| Target Probabilities | The summary file contains the proportion of times (over the simulations) each dose had the greatest probability of being the target. |
| Decision QOIs | The summary file contains the mean (over the simulations) of the final value of the decision QOI at the target. |

## Contents of simulations.csv and weeksNNNNN.csv

The simulations.csv file holds the FACTS summary of the final analysis
for each simulation (one per row).

The weeksNNNNN.csv file holds the FACTS summary of every analysis for
the NNNNN^th^ simulation. It contains a row for each interim in the
trial and a row for the final analysis (Interim number 999).

The final analysis occurs after all the planned data is collected. If the
trial does not stop early, the final analysis occurs after full follow-up
for all subjects. If the trial does stop early at an interim analysis, then
the timing of the final analysis depends on the status of the check boxes
on the [Interims tab](../design/interims.qmd#subject-follow-up-options). If
follow-up is collected after the particular interim decision, then an analysis
after full follow-up of the subjects recruited up to the point of the
interim when the stopping decision was taken. If there is no follow-up
intended after the interim analysis decision, then the final analysis occurs immediately (at the same time as the interim analysis), and the final analysis criteria are checked.

The first line is a header line, starting with a '#', containing the
FACTS GUI version number, the name of the FACTS file, the name of the
scenario, and the time stamp of the start of the simulation.

The second line is a header line, starting with a '#', containing the following
column headings.

Most of the columns are common to the two file types, but the weeks file
does not contain columns for the 'final' values of the evaluation
criteria.

### QOI Columns

The QOI columns depend on the QOIs that have been defined for this
design. The columns are grouped in the following order:


| QOI Type | Description |
|------|----------------|
| Posterior Probabilities | The posterior probability for each QOI for each dose. |
| Predictive Probabilities | The predictive probability for each QOI for each dose. |
| P-Values | The p-value for each QOI for each dose. |
| Target Probabilities | The probability of being the target for each QOI for each dose. |
| Decision QOIs | The value of the decision QOI at the target. |
| Success Futile | A flag for each QOI decision criteria indicating if the decision QOI was evaluated and compared to a threshold at the interim (weeks file) or final analysis (simulation file). The flag value is -1 if the decision QOI was not evaluated, 0 if it did not meet the threshold and 1 if it did. |
| Success / Futile Combined | Flags indicating if the interim or final analysis determined success or futility taking all the factors defined for Success/Futility into account: 0 if the conditions were not met, 1 it the conditions were met. If success and futility conditions have been defined that are not mutually exclusive and both sets of combined conditions are met, FACTS will pick one of the outcomes as met but not the other. In order to discourage defining Success and Futility rules that can both be true FACTS does not guarantee which outcome will be selected. |

## Contents of MCMCNNNNN.csv

The MCMC file if requested for output by the user, contains all the MCMC
samples for the fitted parameters in the design. There is one row per
sample (including the burnin) and the samples from all the analyses in
the simulation are included. The first two columns are the analysis
index and the sample (within analysis) index. The remaining columns are
the parameters whose sample values are being reported, the number and
constituents of these columns are highly variable depending on design of
the statistical analysis.
