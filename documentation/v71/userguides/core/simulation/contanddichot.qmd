# Graphs of Simulation Results

To enable swift visualization and analysis of the simulation results,
FACTS has a number of pre-defined graphs it can display. Full and
detailed simulation results are available in 'csv' format files that can
be loaded into other analysis tools allowing any aspect of the
simulation to be explored. These files are described [below](#output-files).

To view the graphs, select a row of scenario results by clicking on it
and then click on the 'View Graph' button.

Below we have often shown full screen shots of the graphs in the graph
manager, but the graph display supports copying just the graph to the
clipboard to facilitate pasting them into documents and presentations.
Right clicking on a graph brings up a short menu that allows the image
of the graph to be copied to the clipboard or saved in 'png' format to a
file.

To view the graphs of the results of the simulations of a particular
design variant in a particular scenario, select that row of scenario
results by clicking on it and then click on the 'View Graph' button and
select "Show Per Scenario Graphs".

To view multiple graphs showing the results of the simulations of
possibly all the design variants and all the scenarios click on the
'View Graph' button and select "Show Across Scenario Graphs". This
launches a graph display that displays multiple graphs in a trellis
plot. You can select the graph type, filter the design variants and
filter which scenarios displayed:

The graph display supports copying an image of the graph to the
clipboard, to facilitate pasting them into documents and presentations.
Right clicking on a graph brings up a short menu that allows the image
of the graph to be copied to the clipboard or saved in '.png' format to
a file.

Many graphs have a number of controls to allow the graph to be tailored,
standard graph controls available on most graphs are:

-   Set Y axis -- this displays a dialog boxing allowing the user to fix
    the minimum and maximum of each of the Y axes and the number of
    'tick' marks (Not displayed if the 'y' value must lie in the
    interval 0-1.)

-   Space doses evenly -- if the x-value is 'dose', then data for each
    dose can either be spaced equally or proportionate to the doses'
    effective dose strength.

-   If using a 2D treatment arm model then it is possible to display
    graphs where the different doses (or "arms") form the x-axis, then
    there is an option to show the row factors as separate series --
    otherwise the different combinations are displayed in effective
    strength order

#### Box and whisker plot conventions

-   The mean probability is plotted as a large dot.

-   The median value is plotted as a dashed line.

-   The 25-75^th^ quantile range is plotted as the "box" portion of each
    point.

-   The "whiskers" extend to the largest and smallest values within 1 Â½
    times the interquartile range from either end of the box.

-   Points outside the whisker range are considered outliers, and are
    plotted as small blue dots. Note that it may be difficult to see all
    of these symbols if they are plotted at the same value.

The distribution over all simulations of the number of subjects
allocated to each arm shown as a box and whisker plot. If the design
is not adaptive, the number allocated will be the same in every
simulation and the box and whiskers collapse to a single line.

### Response and Subject Allocation

:::

This graph shows for each treatment arm, the mean subject allocation,
mean response and the 2.5%-97.5% boundaries of the estimated means over
the simulations.

-   The blue bars show the mean number of subjects allocated.

-   The black line shows the true mean response being simulated.

-   The green dashed line shows the mean of the estimated response
    across the simulations

-   The green 'error bars' show the spread of the central 95% of the
    estimated mean response across the simulations (if less than 20
    simulations have been run it simply shows the full spread).


### Response and Target Selection graphs

### Dichotomous

![Response and QOI Selection.](../coreUGattachments/dichotomous/media/image42.png){#fig-42d}

:::

These plots show the true simulated mean response and the mean and 95%
spread of the mean fitted mean responses along with bars showing the
proportion of simulations the different treatment arms are the selected
target arm for each of the "Probability of being target" QOIs, such as
[Pr(Max)]{.fake-code-block}, [Pr(EDq relative to ..: Quantile=q)]{.fake-code-block} and [Pr(MED relative to...: Delta=$\delta$)]{.fake-code-block}.

### Per Dose QOIs (Box and Whisker Plots)

This set of graphs show the distribution over the simulations of the
posterior probability estimates of quantities of interest for each dose.
All the Posterior Probability, Predictive Probability, P-value and
Probability of being Target QOIs that have been defined are available
for plotting, via a drop down list.

Note that in any one analysis the Probability of being Target will sum
to 1 across the doses (and can sum to less than one in the case of the
MED target if none of the doses look likely to be better than the CSD),
whereas all the other QOIs are assessed individually for each dose.

![Posterior Mean Response at [P(MED relative to Control: Delta}=0.2)]{.fake-code-block} vs. Total Sample Size per Simulation Run](../coreUGattachments/dichotomous/media/image45.png){#fig-45d}

:::

This graph shows a scatter plot of trial outcomes with the selected
Target QOI as the y-axis and total number of subjects recruited as the
x-axis. The trials are plotted with a symbol that indicated the final
outcome:

-   A light blue circle indicates a trial that stopped early for success

-   A dark blue circle indicates a trial that was a late success

-   A dark red square indicates a trial that was a late futility

-   A light red square indicates a trial that stopped early for futility

-   A light pink diamond indicates a trial that stopped early for
    success but where the final analysis was futility

-   A dark pink diamond indicates a trial that stopped early for
    futility but where the final analysis was success

-   A yellow cross indicates a trial that completed full enrolment but
    was inconclusive at the end.

These graphs are not particularly useful if there is no early stopping.

If the design does allow early stopping this graph shows

-   The overall distribution of sample sizes -- in particular is
    stopping evenly distributed from the moment stopping is possible, or
    is there are large cohort of trials that stop as soon as it is
    possible?

-   When and with what mean response trials stop incorrectly, in
    particular having trials stopping and the decision being reversed
    suggests stopping is allowed to soon or the criteria is not
    conservative enough.

The user can select from any of the Posterior Probability, Predictive
Probability or Target Probability QOIs to plot.

### Per Interim Response Graphs

This is an identical set of graphs to the Per Sim graphs, the difference
is that in addition to a control to select which simulation to graph the
results from, there is a control to select which interim within the
simulation to graph the results from. These graphs are only available
for those simulations for which 'weeks' files have been output (by
default the first 100).

Note the 'Interim' control in both of the below figures.

::::

:::

These graphs can be used to explore what proportion of simulated trials
of a particular scenario would have been a success/failure at final
evaluation. Using the two drop down controls the user can select the
target dose to use: e.g. Pr(Max), and set and lower/upper limits to
explore for the threshold (setting the range used on the x-axis). The
graphs show for all the decision QOIs defined for the selected Target
Dose the proportion of simulations that would have met the threshold
values.

As in the examples above, the plots will be somewhat jagged if only a
small number of simulations have been run. These graphs can be used to
select thresholds that can be expected to yield a certain level of
type-1 or power, but the user must remember these will only be
approximate (depending on the number of simulations) but can be useful
to understand the designs sensitivity to the thresholds and to set
initial thresholds early on in the design / simulation process that will
get close to the desired type-1 error and power from the outset.

### Explore Early Success/Futility Criteria

::::

:::

These graphs can be used to explore what proportion of simulated trials
of a particular scenario would have stopped early for success/futility.
NOTE these graphs require weeks files to have been output, they are also
most use where the design has been simulated with interims but no early
stopping (unlike the examples above where the shape of the "existing
stopping rules" line indicates that early stopping occurred in these
simulations).

Using the two drop down controls, the user can select which decision QOI
is evaluated and from which interim onwards stopping will be permitted.
Lines are then displayed for the proportion of simulations that would
have stopped by each interim for a fixed set of thresholds.

Typically these can be used to see at what threshold (and starting at
what interim) stopping for success or futility introduces an
unacceptably level of 'incorrect' early stopping -- stopping for
futility in successful scenarios and stopping for success in futile
scenarios and whether at below/above these levels there may be a useful
probability of correct stopping.

dropped is displayed.

![Proportion of Simulations Reaching Success for Early/Late Criterion Thresholds](../coreUGattachments/dichotomous/media/image65.png){#fig-65d}

::::

:::

These graphs allow early stopping and final evaluation criteria to be
considered jointly. Like the explore early stopping criteria plots,
these graphs require weeks files to have been output and will work best
if interims were evaluated but no trials actually stopped early.

The user selects the decision QOI to plot, the first interim at which
early stopping is allowed, and the upper/lower limit of the threshold to
consider.

FACTS will then plot contours where (final evaluation threshold, early
stopping threshold) yield the same proportion of trials that are
successful/futile. Contours are only plotted where final evaluation
threshold \< early stopping threshold for success and vice versa for
futility. Early stopping criteria should not be less strict than final
criteria.

Again the example graphs shown are based on only 100 simulations with
weeks files, so any threshold derived will only very approximately yield
these success/futility rates.

:::

If an MCMC sample file has been output for one or more simulations (the
default is to not output MCMC sample files due to their size), then
for each of those simulations it is possible to view the MCMC trace of
the sampled values for each of the parameters sampled in the MCMC.

If the design is adaptive, the user can select which interim ("update")
the samples are from, as well as which parameter's samples to plot.

## Across Scenario Graphs

### Selected Arms

This graph shows a bar chart for each scenario and variant selected.
Each chart shows how often each arm was 'selected' by the target QOI
specified on the Study \> Variants tab. Each bar uses a stacked bar to
show the proportion of times that arm was:

-   "Successful" --the arm was correctly selected (marked as "Should
    succeed" on the VSR tab) and the trial was successful.

-   "Should not succeed" -- the arm was incorrectly selected (not marked
    as "Should succeed" on the VSR tab) and the trial was successful.

-   Unsuccessful -- the arm was selected and the trial failed.

### Interim vs Final Scatter Plot

This is an interactive plot that shows the outcome of each simulation
over all the scenarios of a selected variant.

The x-axis shows the value of the selected decision QOI at the specified
interim, and the y-axis shows the final value of a (possibly different)
selected decision QOI. As well as selecting a decision QOI for the final
decision, the graph can use the actual final decision in the simulations
-- the value of the QOI used in the first criteria is used for the
decision is used for the y-axis.

Note the graph is based just on the values at the selected interim, what
might happen at other interims is ignored.

Thresholds can be set to specify early and late success/futility. Each
scenario is then coloured to show its outcome -- and stacked bar graphs
are displayed to show the proportion of each outcome for each scenario.
The thresholds can be changed and the graph re-drawn. If the selected
QOI uses a p-value the checks for success are that it is "\<" than the
threshold, (and vice-versa for futility), otherwise the checks for
success are that it is "\>" the threshold (and vice-versa for futility).

The graph can only display the results for simulations for which cohorts
files have been output, and for simulations that reached the specified
interim. Thus the graph works best if interims have been specified, but
the simulations run without any early stopping enabled -- so each
simulation has the results for every interim.

With 1,000 simulations per scenario and cohorts files for each
simulation, the graph will take several seconds to re-draw. To allow
several parameters to be set before redrawing (rather than having to
wait for the redraw after each change) the graph is only redrawn after
the 'Redraw' button is clicked.

### Receiver Operating Characteristics

This graph plots the relative proportion of successful simulations in
the scenarios compared to the proportion of successes in one specific
scenario. The intended use of this is to yield a "Receiver Operating
Characteristics" (ROC) curve. This is done as follows:

-   Select the decision QoI that is to be used to determine final
    success/futility. (The graph only supports the simple case where
    just one is being used).

-   Select a scenario that represents the 'Null' case -- where
    determining success is a type-1 error.

-   If multiple variants have been simulated, select which variant to
    plot.

FACTS computes for the null scenario, for a range of decision threshold
values, what proportion of the 'Null' scenario sims would have been
successful (giving the estimated type-1 error rate), these proportions
form the x-values for each point. The corresponding threshold values are
shown on the x-axis at the top of the graph, the type-1 error rate on
the x-axis at the bottom of the graph.

FACTS then computes for each of the other scenarios in turn the
proportion of sims that would have been successful **and selected a
"should succeed" dose** so it is necessary for doses to have been
specified as "should succeed" on the Virtual Subject Response profiles
(giving the estimate of power for that scenario -- where 'power' also
requires correct dose selection), at each of the threshold values, these
proportions are then shown on the y-axis of the graph.

Thus for each scenario we can see the estimated power of the design to
determine success for a given type-1 error rate in the specified Null
scenario.

# Viewing Simulation Results in the Simulations Tab

After simulations have been run, FACTS provides a table for assessing
the output from the simulations. While everything that FACTS displays in
the table on the Simulation tab is available in output files, FACTS does
a substantial amount of "beautifying" of results in its built-in table.
This entails changes like converting numeric outcome scores to readable text and
using descriptive names for QOI columns.

The main table has 1 line per scenario, and
shows the summary of all simulations run for each scenario. These lines
show values that are stored in the summary.csv file.

More detailed simulation output, providing a row per simulation run, is
accessibile by double clicking on any row of the output table. This row-per-simulation
output is what is stored in the simulations.csv files.

Additional detail is available for simulations that have a weeks file by right
clicking on a simulation in the simulation summary window and selecting
"Weeks Results". See the Results Output section of the Simulation tab to
specify the number of weeks files to be output.

## Summary per Scenario

By default, only a subset of all columns of output are provided when simulations are
complete. This set of columns is called "Highlights." To get access to further
columns, you can right click anywhere on the simulation output table and click
"Summary Results: ...." for whichever set of columns you would like to see. There
is a "Summary Results: All" option that will provide a pop up containing every
column available for summary results.

The following sections break down which columns are available by sorting to
which column subset.

### Highlights

These are the columns displayed on the simulations tab after simulations
are completed, the can also be displayed in the separate "Highlights"
results window.

|          |         |                                                |
|          |         | An MED target is not guaranteed to be          |
|          |         | identifiable, if no dose meets the CSD         |
|          |         | criteria in any MCMC sample so all doses have  |
|          |         | a 0 probability of having a response greater   |
|          |         | than Control (or AC) by the CSD then no dose   |
|          |         | is the MED. So the sum of each Ppn(target) QOI |
|          |         | across the doses should sum to between 0 and 1 |
|          |         | inclusive.                                     |

|          |         | separately, but their component QOIs -- the    |

## Detailed Per Simulation Results

After simulation has completed and simulation results have been loaded,
the user may examine detailed results for any scenario with simulations output
in the table by double-clicking on the appropriate row. A separate window pops up and displays the results for each individual simulation.
This is a "prettier" view of the contents of the "simulations.csv" file, which is described
below. The simulations results are partitioned into the same
results groupings as the summary results. These can be accessed from the
"right click" menu, along with opening the results folder, opening the
weeks file for a particular simulation and opening the simulated
patients file for a particular simulation (where a "weeks" file or a
"patients" file has been output).

![The simulation results pop out viewer showing simulation highlights.](../coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image88.png){#fig-highlights}

# Output Files

Instead of viewing simulation output on the Simulation tab within FACTS,
the output is all contained within easily accessible files saved the the
user's local machine. FACTS stores the results of simulations as '.csv'
files under a Results folder. For each row in the simulations table,
there is a folder named by the profiles that make up the scenario, which
contains the corresponding '.csv' files.

![The windows file explorer when opened to the directory containing simulation output.](../coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image89.png){#fig-windowsexplorer}

These files can be opened using Microsoft Excel, but versions of Excel
before 2007 are restricted to 256 columns, which is too few to view some
files in their entirety. The 'Calc' application in 'OpenOffice' will
show all the columns (and will open two files that have the same name at
the same time!). Because Excel takes out a file lock on any file it has
open, while a file is open in Excel it cannot be deleted or modified by
another application. The most common cause for an error to be reported
when simulating trials in FACTS is because the user has one of the
previous results files is still open in Excel.

In the scenario directory there are the following types of results file:

**Summary.csv** Contains a single row of data that summarizes the
simulation results. This is the source of the shown on the simulations
tab.

<span class="custom-tooltip"> **Summary_freq_bocf_NNNNN.csv,** <span class="tooltip-text">Continuous only.</span> </span> **Summary_freq_locf_NNNN.csv,** **Summary_freq_ignore_NNNN.csv,** <span class="custom-tooltip"> **Summary_freq_fail_NNNNN.csv,** <span class="tooltip-text">Dichotomous only.</span> </span>  Contains a single row of data that that
summarizes the frequentist analysis of the simulations. A file is output
for each of the different methods for dealing with missing data that are
selected on the Frequentist Analysis tab: BOCF if the baseline score is being simulated, LOCF and
"ignore" (referred to as PP (Per-Protocol) in the GUI).

**Simulations.csv** Contains one row per simulation describing the final
state of each simulation for every trial simulated.

**Simulations_freq.csv** Contains one row per simulation describing the
frequentist analysis of the final state of each simulation for every
trial simulated.

**PatientsNNNNN.csv** Contains one row per patient in a simulation,
where NNNNN is the number of the simulation. By default this file is
written out only for the first simulation, but this can be changed on
the simulations tab.

**WeeksNNNNN.csv** Contains one row for each cohort during a simulation
where NNN is the number of the simulation. By default this file is
written only for the first 100 simulations, but this can be changed via
the simulation tab. The values in the last row of the cohorts file will
be the same as the final values for that simulation in the simulations
file.

<span class="custom-tooltip"> **weeks_freq_bocf_NNNNN.csv,** <span class="tooltip-text">Continuous only.</span> </span> **weeks_freq_locf_NNNN.csv,** **weeks_freq_ignore_NNNN.csv,** <span class="custom-tooltip"> **weeks_freq_fail_NNNNN.csv,** <span class="tooltip-text">Dichotomous only.</span> </span> Contains one row for each interim during a simulation where NNNNN is the
number of the simulation. A file is output for each simulation for which
a frequentist "weeks file" is to be output, and for each of the
different methods for dealing with missing data that are applicable.

## Contents of summary.csv

The first line is a header line, starting with a '#', containing the
FACTS GUI version number, the name of the FACTS file, the name of the
scenario, and the time stamp of the start of the simulation.

The second line is a header line, starting with a '#', containing the following
column headings.

### QOI Columns

The QOI columns depend on the QOIs that have been defined for this
design. The columns in the following order:

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Posterior Probabilities | The summary file contains the mean (over the simulations) of the posterior probability for each dose. |
| Predictive Probabilities | The summary file contains the mean (over the simulations) of the predictive probability for each dose. |
| P-Values | The summary file contains the mean (over the simulations) of the p-value for each dose. |
| Target Probabilities | The summary file contains the proportion of times (over the simulations) each dose had the greatest probability of being the target. |
| Decision QOIs | The summary file contains the mean (over the simulations) of the final value of the decision QOI at the target. |

## Contents of Summary_freq_{missingnessType}.csv

There is a frequentist summary file for each type of treatment of
missing values.

The first line is a header line, starting with a '#', containing the
FACTS GUI version number, the name of the FACTS file, the name of the
scenario, and the time stamp of the start of the simulation.

The second line is a header line, starting with a '#', containing the following
column headings.

## Contents of simulations.csv and weeksNNNNN.csv

The simulations.csv file holds the FACTS summary of the final analysis
for each simulation (one per row).

The weeksNNNNN.csv file holds the FACTS summary of every analysis for
the NNNNN^th^ simulation. It contains a row for each interim in the
trial and a row for the final analysis (Interim number 999).

The final analysis occurs after all the planned data is collected. If the
trial does not stop early, the final analysis occurs after full follow-up
for all subjects. If the trial does stop early at an interim analysis, then
the timing of the final analysis depends on the status of the check boxes
on the [Interims tab](../design/interims.qmd#subject-follow-up-options). If
follow-up is collected after the particular interim decision, then an analysis
after full follow-up of the subjects recruited up to the point of the
interim when the stopping decision was taken. If there is no follow-up
intended after the interim analysis decision, then the final analysis occurs immediately (at the same time as the interim analysis), and the final analysis criteria are checked.

The first line is a header line, starting with a '#', containing the
FACTS GUI version number, the name of the FACTS file, the name of the
scenario, and the time stamp of the start of the simulation.

The second line is a header line, starting with a '#', containing the following
column headings.

Most of the columns are common to the two file types, but the weeks file
does not contain columns for the 'final' values of the evaluation
criteria.

### QOI Columns

The QOI columns depend on the QOIs that have been defined for this
design. The columns are grouped in the following order:

| QOI Type | Description |
|------|----------------|
| Posterior Probabilities | The posterior probability for each QOI for each dose. |
| Predictive Probabilities | The predictive probability for each QOI for each dose. |
| P-Values | The p-value for each QOI for each dose. |
| Target Probabilities | The probability of being the target for each QOI for each dose. |
| Decision QOIs | The value of the decision QOI at the target. |
| Success Futile | A flag for each QOI decision criteria indicating if the decision QOI was evaluated and compared to a threshold at the interim (weeks file) or final analysis (simulation file). The flag value is -1 if the decision QOI was not evaluated, 0 if it did not meet the threshold and 1 if it did. |
| Success / Futile Combined | Flags indicating if the interim or final analysis determined success or futility taking all the factors defined for Success/Futility into account: 0 if the conditions were not met, 1 it the conditions were met. If success and futility conditions have been defined that are not mutually exclusive and both sets of combined conditions are met, FACTS will pick one of the outcomes as met but not the other. In order to discourage defining Success and Futility rules that can both be true FACTS does not guarantee which outcome will be selected. |

## Contents of Simulations_freq_{missingnessType}.csv, Weeks_freq_{missingnessType}.csv

These file contain the frequentist results after an interim analysis
(weeks file) or final analysis (simulations file), apart for the first
column, the columns are the same in the two types of file, and the same
across the different methods for treating missing data.

### Continuous

| Column | Number of columns | Description |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Subject | 1 | The subject id number, starting at 1. |
| Region  | 1 | Which region the subject was recruited in. |
| Date    | 1 | The date, in weeks from the start of the trial, of the subject's baseline visit and randomization. |
| Dose    | 1 | The index number (1, ...) of the treatment arm the subject belongs to. |
| LastVisit# | 1 | The index of the last visit for which the subjects data was collected, if the subject did not complete all of its visits it could be because they dropped-out, the subject's treatment arm was dropped (and there was no follow-up), or the study stopped early (and there was no follow-up). |
| Dropout | 1 | Whether the subject dropped out of the trial (1) or not (0) before reaching their final visit. |
| Baseline | 1 | Subject baseline response, if simulated. If not simulated, then fixed at -9999. |
| Visit \<Visit\> | V | Subject's response at each visit. |

### Dichotomous

| Column | Number of columns | Description |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Subject | 1 | The subject id number, starting at 1. |
| Region  | 1 | Which region the subject was recruited in. |
| Date    | 1 | The date, in weeks from the start of the trial, of the subject's baseline visit and randomization. |
| Dose    | 1 | The index number (1, ...) of the treatment arm the subject belongs to. |
| LastVisit# | 1 | The index of the last visit for which the subjects data was collected, if the subject did not complete all of its visits it could be because they dropped-out, the subject's treatment arm was dropped (and there was no follow-up), or the study stopped early (and there was no follow-up). |
| Dropout | 1 | Whether the subject dropped out of the trial (1) or not (0) before reaching their final visit. |
| Baseline | 1 | Always -9999 since there's no baseline in dichotomous response trials. |
| Visit \<Visit\> | V | Subject's response at each visit. |

## Contents of MCMCNNNNN.csv

The MCMC file if requested for output by the user, contains all the MCMC
samples for the fitted parameters in the design. There is one row per
sample (including the burnin) and the samples from all the analyses in
the simulation are included. The first two columns are the analysis
index and the sample (within analysis) index. The remaining columns are
the parameters whose sample values are being reported, the number and
constituents of these columns are highly variable depending on design of
the statistical analysis.

### Continuous

| Column | Number of columns | Description |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Analysis | 1 | The index of the analysis (interim) in the simulation. |
| Sample | 1 | The index of the sample within the analysis. |
| Theta \<Dose\> | D | The estimate of the mean response for each dose, based on the dose response model fitted. |
| Sigma | 1 | The estimate of the SD of the endpoint. |
| Beta | 1 | If baseline is included in the simulated data and using the "Baseline Adjusted Model", this is the value of "Beta", the baseline coefficient. |
| A <1-8> / Tau | P | If the dose response model estimates parameters then the samples of these are listed next. The number and name of the parameters will vary depending on the model being fitted. Check the Design > Dose Response tab for a listing of the parameters. |
| Longmod \<Model\> \<Param\> \<Visit\> | L\*P\*V | If the analysis includes longitudinal modelling then the samples of the parameters of the longitudinal models are output. The number of models depends on the number of different longitudinal fits the user has specified (one over all arms, one for control and one for all treatment arms, model all arms separately, etc.), the number of parameters the model has, and if these are fitted per visit (which depends on the model being fitted), then the number of visits. |

### Dichotomous

If using a dichotomized continuous variable, then the parameters for
the LM are the same as for the continuous model MCMC output listed in
the Continuous tab.

If using a dichotomous longitudinal model, then the following parameters
are output in the MCMC file.

| Column | Number of columns | Description |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Analysis | 1 | The index of the analysis (interim) in the simulation. |
| Sample | 1 | The index of the sample within the analysis. |
| Pi \<Dose\> | D | The estimate of the response rate for each dose, based on the dose response model fitted. |
| A <1-8> / Tau | P | If the dose response model estimates parameters then the samples of these are listed next. The number and name of the parameters will vary depending on the model being fitted. Check the Design > Dose Response tab for a listing of the parameters. |
| Longmod \<Model\> \<Param\> \<Visit\> | L\*P\*V | If the analysis includes longitudinal modelling then the samples of the parameters of the longitudinal models are output. The number of models depends on the number of different longitudinal fits the user has specified (one over all arms, one for control and one for all treatment arms, model all arms separately, etc.), the number of parameters the model has, and if these are fitted per visit (which depends on the model being fitted), then the number of visits. |

If using a restricted markov model, then the following parameters
are output in the MCMC file.

| Column | Number of columns | Description |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Analysis | 1 | The index of the analysis (interim) in the simulation. |
| Sample | 1 | The index of the sample within the analysis. |
| Pi \<Dose\> | D | The estimate of the response rate for each dose, based on the dose response model fitted. |
| A <1-8> / Tau | P | If the dose response model estimates parameters then the samples of these are listed next. The number and name of the parameters will vary depending on the model being fitted. Check the Design > Dose Response tab for a listing of the parameters. |
| Longmod \<Model\> \<Param\> \<Visit\> | L\*P\*V | Currently the values of Alpha0, Alpha1, AlphaS (the parameters to the Dirichlet distribution) are (unnecessarily â these values are not sampled) output, along with the values for P0, P1 and PS the transition probabilities of each model at each visit. |
