The Virtual Subject Response tab allows the user to explicitly define
virtual subject response profiles, and/or to import virtual externally
simulated patient responses. When simulations
are executed, they will be executed for a specific scenario -- where a
scenario is a combination of one each of predictor VSR,
control hazard rate, dose response VSR, accrual rate, and dropout rate. If an external
file is used to specify the subject responses to be simulated, this
effectively replaces the predictor, control hazard and dose response
profiles in a scenario.

Unlike other endpoints where just a response (mean change from base line
or rate) is specified, specification of subject responses for a
time-to-event endpoint is done by first specifying a piecewise
exponential event rate for the control population and then hazard ratios
for the treatment arms. For simplicity, this means of specifying the
simulated event rates is also used when no control arm is present and
the comparison is with historic control rates.

In FACTS Core TTE, there is also the ability to include the simulation
of a 'predictor' endpoint. Predictor endpoints can be a continuous
measure, dichotomous outcome, or a precursor event. The interface for
specifying how the predictor endpoint data is to be simulated is
different in each case.

# Specifying VSR with no predictor

## Explicitly Defined

With no predictor, there are two screens for defining virtual subject
responses; the first is used to define the control hazard rate and the
second to define the hazard ratio of the events on each arm to control.

### Control Hazard Rates

The user may create a number of different control hazard rate profiles
to simulate from. The different profiles will be used to define
different simulation scenarios in combination with other profiles
defining the other properties that have to be simulated.

The hazard rate to simulate in a profile is specified as a piecewise
exponential. The follow-up time can be divided into different time
segments and a different event rate simulated in each segment.

Segment boundaries and hazard rates are always entered using "weeks" as
the time unit. While this might not always be the most convenient, it
allows FACTS to use the same time unit everywhere.

Different segments in the follow-up period are specified by adding
segment ends. Adding a 'segment end' adds a segment interval to the list
to allow the event rate for that interval to be specified. To delete an
interval, select the interval starting with the breakpoint to be deleted
and click the "Delete" button.

The graph can show the hazard rate, the cumulative probability of not
having an event or the probability of not having seen an event over
time, using the event rates specified. This is useful for checking that
the segments and event rates have been entered correctly.

![The tab for specifying the control arm hazard rate for an explicitly defined VSR.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image18.png){#fig-ctrlhaz}

### Dose Response

The user may create a number of different dose response profiles to
simulate from. The different profiles will be used to define different
simulation scenarios in combination with other profiles defining the
other properties that have to be simulated.

Within each profile the user specifies:

1.  The hazard ratio compared to control for each treatment arm (except
    control itself, where of course the ratio is 1).

2.  A check box that allows the user to specify whether a specific arm
    "should succeed" in that scenario: so that FACTS can report on the
    proportion of simulations that were successful **and** a 'good'
    treatment arm selected.

On the graph the different hazard ratios for the profile are plotted,
along with the 'target' -- this is the default CSHRD or NIHRD offset
from the QOI tab, the direction of the offset is dependent on whether
events are 'good' or 'bad' and whether the aim of the trial is to show
superiority on non-inferiority.

![Specify the hazard ratio per dose](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image19.png){#fig-ttehr}

### Loading Scenario Control Hazard Rates and Scenario Hazard Ratios from file

If the "Load scenario hazard rates from a file" option is selected then
in scenarios using this profile the simulations will use a range of dose
responses across the simulations.

Each individual simulation uses one set of responses from the supplied
file, each row being used in an equal number of simulations. The summary
results are thus averaged over all the VSRs in the file. The use of this
form of simulation is somewhat different from simulations using a single
rate or single external virtual subject response file. When all the
simulations are simulated from a single version of the 'truth' then the
purpose of the simulations is to analyse the performance of the design
under that specific circumstance. When the simulations are based on a
range of 'truths' loaded from an '.mvsr' file then the summary results
show the expected probability of the different outcomes for the trial
over that range of possible circumstances. Note that to give different
VSRs different weights of expectation, the more likely VSRs should be
repeated within the file.

For a TTE endpoint the user must supply 2 files -- one for the Control
Hazard Rates and one for the Hazard Ratios in each group. MVSR hazard
rates are only combined with MVSR control hazard rates. The lines from
each file are paired up for each simulation, so the first control hazard
rate is used with the first dose response hazard ratio, the second
control hazard rate is used with the second dose response hazard ratio
and so on. There must be the same number of lines in each file.

![Load a scenario's control hazard rates from an external file.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image20.png){#fig-extctrlhaz}

After selecting the ".mvsr" file the graph shows the different control
hazard rates over time.

![Load a scenario's treatment hazard ratios from an external file.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image21.png){#fig-exttrthr}

After selecting the ".mvsr" file the graph shows the different
individual hazard ratios for each dose.

The VSR parameters are provided in two separate files, (the number of
lines in the files should be the same for the two files). The formats
are:

-   Control Hazard Rate File: Each line should contain columns \[L~1~,
    L~2~, ... , L~S~\] giving the true control hazard rates ($\lambda$) for
    each of the S segments. (Note: FACTS will treat the hazard rate as
    per week).:

-   Hazard Ratio File: Each line should contain columns \[HR~1~, HR~2~,
    ... , HR~D~\] giving the true Mean Hazard Ratios for each of the D
    dose arms. (Note: HR~1~ = 1 by definition, but the column of 1's to
    be included here for completeness.)

The use of MVSR files has not been extended to the case where a
predictor is being used.

## External Files

As well as simulating subject responses within FACTS they can be
simulated externally and imported into
FACTS where the supplied responses are sampled from when simulating the
trial. The specification of a file containing subject response data can be
done from the External Files sub-tab depicted in @fig-externalfiles below.

To import an external file, the user must first add a profile to the
table. After adding the profile, the user must click "Browse" to locate
the file of externally simulated data. The user will then be prompted to
locate the external file on their computer with a dialog box.

![The external files sub-tab for uploading patient data to be sampled from.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image32.png){#fig-externalfiles}

### Required Format of Externally Simulated Data

The supplied data should have the following columns:

1)  Patient id, these must be positive integers and unique

2)  Arm Index (1 = Control, 2 = Treatment1, 3 = Treatment2, ...)

3)  Uncensored time to event in weeks

4)  This column is a placeholder for predictor data. It may be filled out or
    empty when there is no predictor. It will be ignored.

**The GUI requires that the file name has a ".dat" suffix. The file need
not have column headers, but if it does the first column name must start
with a pound sign (#) which tells FACTS to ignore that row.**

The following shows values from an example file with a dichotomous
predictor. Unlike other endpoints there is only one line per subject, as
there is no need to record the subject's state at interim visits.

| #Patient ID | Dose Index | Uncensored Time to Event (weeks) | Optional Predictor value |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 8.87 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 9.34 | 0 |
| 3 | 2 | 6.78 | -9999 |
| 4 | 2 | 10.23 | 0 |
| 5 | 2 | 9.96 | 0 |
| 6 | 2 | 5.6 | 1 |
| 7 | 1 | 37.01 | 20.36 |
| 8 | 1 | 28.67 | 0 |
| 9 | 1 | 39.70 | 0 |

In the above, column headers have been included to make it clearer to read but
they are not required.

Simulated subjects will be drawn from this supplied list, with
replacement, to provide the simulated response values.

# Specifying VSR with a predictor

FACTS supports the specification of the simulation of events and
predictors in two ways:

1.  Specification of the predictor and then specification of the
    subject's time-to-event dependent on the predictor

2.  Specification of the subject's event rate and then specification of
    the predictor dependent on the event rate simulated

## Explicitly Defined (Event Rate | Predictor)

The first method (described in this section) may in some circumstances
be the more natural way to think of the data (we might want to simulate
for instance that subjects with a reduction in tumor size have a longer
survival time), however it gives rise to data which does not have an
exponential distribution. To retain an exponential distribution in the
simulated event rate it is necessary to use the second method where the
control rate and treatment arm hazard ratios are specified first and
then the probability of the observed predictor derived from that
(described in the next section).

### Continuous Predictor

If a predictor with a continuous endpoint is being used then there is a
new tab in the VSR section to allow the specification of profiles that
define how the predictor endpoint is to be simulated.

#### Predictor

Firstly, the predictor endpoint to be simulated is specified in the same
way as a FACTS Core continuous endpoint. A number of profiles can be
specified, in each one the mean change from baseline of the predictor
for each treatment arm is specified, along with the variability in the
change. The variability is specified as the SD of a Normal error in the
observed change, a single value can be specified for all arms, or
separate values for each arm.

The mean hazard rate for the simulated subjects now depends on the value
of the predictor $Z$, the baseline hazard rate for the time segment
$\mu_{s}$, the log hazard ratio for the dose $\theta_{d}$, and with
parameters $b_{Zd}$, *center* and *scale* for the predictor:

$$h_{sdZ} = \mu_{s}exp\left( \theta_{d} \right)\exp\left( b_{Zd}\frac{Z - center}{scale} \right)$$

Note that in this form of the predictor, the observed event rate is
affected by the predictor, it will not be the same as specified in the
dose-response profile, also the observed times to event will not be
exponentially distributed. The impact of this is best understood by
simulating the patient responses and performing rough analyses (e.g. in
R).

For example, with a control hazard rate of 0.01, and dose response
hazard ratio of 1, when a continuous predictor is added with SD 2, and
mean response of 1 on control and 3 on the treatment arm, with center
specified at 2, scale at 3 and $b_{z}$ at 0.2, simulations of 1000
subjects' times-to-events on each of control and treatment arm give
(ignoring censoring) a HR of between 1.05 and 1.21.

Note that if events are bad and higher predictor scores indicate subject
improvement (lower hazard rate) then the $b_{z}$ coefficients need to be
negative. The same is true if events are good and lower predictor scores
indicate subject improvement.

![Specifying the continuous predictor's VSR and how it effects the hazard rate for an arm.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image22.png){#fig-contpredVSR}

On the graph showing the predictor response to be simulated, the
'target' line shows the offset of the predictor CSD from the predictor
response on the Control arm.

#### Control Hazard Rates

With a continuous predictor, the control hazard rate tab does not
change. It's the same as [the non-predictor tab](#control-hazard-rates).

#### Dose Response

The manner of specifying the dose response does not change -- multiple
profiles may be specified and in each profile the hazard ratio for each
treatment arm is specified. However, the overall hazard ratio simulated
will depend on the combination of the control hazard rate, the dose
response hazard ratio and the effect of the predictor on the final event
rate.

This leads to two different ways for the predictor to be brought into
the simulation. First, the hazard ratios $\theta_{d}$ may all be 1,
while the mean of the predictor may change across doses. This would
indicate that dose makes no difference given a fixed value of the
predictor, but that the different doses achieve their effect by changing
the distribution of the predictor values themselves. If the $\theta_{d}$
values differ from 1, then this indicates that there is a dose effect
even conditional on a fixed value of the predictor (thus, for example, a
control subject with Z=1 has a different hazard than a treatment subject
with Z=1).

The resulting hazard ratio is plotted in the graph at the bottom of the
tab. The predictor profile and control hazard rate profile to use in
generating the graph can be selected in the controls to the right of the
graph.

![Specify the hazard ratio per arm. The true simulated hazard ratio will be a combination of this value and the values provided in the predictor tab.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image23.png){#fig-contpreddoseresponse}

### Dichotomous Predictor

When simulating the event rate conditional on the predictor, the
predictor endpoint to be simulated is specified in the same way as a for
a simple dichotomous endpoint, the control hazard rate is specified
separately for each dichotomous predictor value, and the Dose Response
for the time-to-event endpoint has a hazard ratio that depends on the
dichotomous predictor's value.

So, the effect of the predictor on the background event rate is seen on
the control hazard rate tab, and on the treatment arm hazard ratios on
the dose response tab.

On those tabs the user specifies

-   separate control hazard rates for subjects who have a predictor
    response and those who do not

-   separate hazard ratios for each dose for subjects who have a
    predictor response and those who do not.

The hazard rates and ratios apply from the moment a subject is recruited
(they do not change after the dichotomous predictor is assessed) and do
not depend on the predictor being observed (which could be prevented if
the event happens first).

![Specifying the dichotomous predictor's probability of response for each arm.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image24.png){#fig-dichpred}

The graph shows the specified response rate for each treatment arm and
the target rate on control plus CSD.

#### Control Hazard Rate with Dichotomous Predictor

![Specify the control arm hazard rate for each potential value of the dichotomous predictor.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image25.png){#fig-dichpredctrl}

As usual, multiple control hazard rate profiles can be created and the
hazard rate on the control arm specified over different time segments.
What differs from the case where there is no predictor is that, if a
dichotomous predictor (with event rate simulated dependent on the
predictor) is being used, separate hazard rates are specified for
subjects depending on whether or not they will have the dichotomous
predictor response or not.

#### Dose Response with a Dichotomous Predictor

![Specify the hazard ratio for active arms given the value of the dichotomous predictor.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image26.png){#fig-dichpreddoseresponse}

As usual, multiple dose response profiles can be created, and in each
profile the hazard ratio to simulate for each treatment arm compared to
the control arm is specified. What differs from the case where there is
no predictor, is that, if a dichotomous predictor is being used,
separate hazard ratios are specified for subjects depending on whether
or not they will have the dichotomous predictor response or not.

As with the continuous predictor, the observed event rate is affected by
the predictor (it will not be the same as specified in the dose-response
profile). Similarly, the observed times to event will not be
exponentially distributed. The graph shows the effective combined hazard
ratio for a given combination of control hazard rate, predictor rates
and dose response. The controls for selecting which control hazard rate
and which predictor rates to use are to the right of the graph.

The impact is best understood by simulating the patient responses and
performing rough analyses (e.g. in R).

For example, with a predictor response rate on control of 0.1 and
control hazard rates of 0.01 (with a predictor response) and 0.02 (with
no predictor response), and treatment arm with a predictor response rate
of 0.2 and hazard ratios of 0.9 (with a predictor response) and 0.8
(with no predictor response), simulations of 1000 subjects times to
events on each of control and treatment arm give (ignoring censoring) a
HR of between 0.75 and 0.90.

### Time-to-Event Predictor

#### Predictor

The predictor endpoint to be simulated is specified in a similar manner
to specifying the simulation of a time to event endpoint. A number of
profiles can be specified; in each one the hazard rate on the control
arm is specified over one, or more, time segments, and the overall
hazard ratio of the time to the predictor event of each treatment arm to
the control arm is specified.

The simulation of the time to the final event is in terms of the event
rate (over one, or more, time segments) on the control arm after the
predictor event, and then the hazard ratio of the time to the final
event after the predictor event of each treatment arm to the control
arm.

On those tabs the user specifies

-   separate control hazard rates for subjects post predictor event

-   hazard ratios for each treatment arm the time to final event, after
    the predictor event has occurred.

![Specifying the dichotomous predictor's control hazard rate and active arm hazard ratios for each arm.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image27.png){#fig-ttepred}

Multiple predictor profiles can be created.

For each profile the control hazard rate can be specified over an
arbitrary set of time segments (i.e the time segments can vary from
profile to profile, can be different from the observation times (if any)
and different from the time segments used in the analysis model.

The hazard ratio of the control arm to itself has to be 1 and cannot be
modified. For the other treatment arms, the time to predictor event is
specified by specifying the hazard ratio on that treatment arm, to the
control arm.

The graph can be used to show the hazard rate, probability of event or
probability of not having the event on each arm.

#### Control Hazard Rates

Specifying the simulation of the control hazard rate with a TTE
predictor is the same as specifying the control hazard rate without a
predictor. The difference is that with a TTE predictor, the hazard rate
specified here is only simulated after the predictor has been seen.

![Specify the control arm's event rate after the predictor endpoint event has occured.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image28.png){#fig-ttepredctrl}

#### Dose Response

![Specify the hazard ratio for the active arms on the hazard rate after the predictor event is observed. The primary endpoint event time can also be set to equal the predictor event time with some probability.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image29.png){#fig-ttepreddoseresponse}

As usual, multiple hazard ratio profiles can be created, and in each
profile the hazard ratio to simulate each treatment arm compared to the
control arm specified. What differs from the case where there is no
predictor is that if a TTE predictor is being used,

1.  the hazard ratios are specified for the occurrence of the final
    event having observed the predictor event

2.  a probability can be specified that the post predictor event to
    endpoint event time is 0.

As with the continuous predictor, the observed event rate is affected by
the predictor, it will not be the same as the hazard ratio for endpoint
post event predictor. The observed times to event will not be
exponentially distributed. The impact is best understood by simulating
the patient responses and performing rough analyses (e.g. in R).

For example, with a predictor hazard rate on control of 0.1 and post
predictor hazard rates of 0.01 and probability that the post predictor
event time is 0 of 0.1, and treatment arm with a predictor hazard ratio
of 0.9 and post predictor hazard ratio of 0.8 and probability that the
post predictor event time is 0 of 0.1, simulations of 1000 subjects
times to events on each of control and treatment arm give (ignoring
censoring) a HR of between 0.74 and 0.88.

## Explicitly Defined (Predictor | Event Rate)

To simulate event times and an associated predictor with a possible
correlation between the two in a way that preserves the exponential
distribution of the event times, use this tab to specify the simulation
of subjects' time to event first and then the probability of the
observed predictor derived from that. This is only supported for
Dichotomous and TTE predictors.

The "Explicitly Defined (Predictor \| Event Rate)" tab allows the
specification of profiles that define how the predictor endpoint is to
be simulated in relation to the control hazard rate and hazard ratios
for the final events. This allows the simulated final observed final
events to still have an exponential distribution.

Once the time-to-event for a subjects has been simulated, a simple user
specified transformation of the time-to-final-event provides the
expected value of the predictor's distributions.

### Dichotomous

When using a dichotomous predictor, control hazard rates and dose
response hazard ratios are specified as when there is [no predictor](#explicitly-defined).

#### Predictor

![Specify the distribution of the predictor per arm given the uncensored endpoint value for a patient.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image30.png){#fig-dichpredgiveneventrate}

As usual, multiple profiles can be defined. To simulate the dichotomous
endpoint given the event rate, the predictor values are simulated by
drawing from the Bernoulli distribution with probability given by the
inverse logit($\alpha + \beta Y$), where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are specified here
and $Y$ is the subject's final time to event (in weeks). A single set of
values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can be specified, or separate values per treatment
arm can be specified. The expected response rate is shown in the plot at
the bottom of the predictor tab.

### Time-to-Event

When simulating a time-to-event predictor, control hazard rates and dose
response hazard ratios are specified as when there is [no predictor](#explicitly-defined).

#### Predictor

![Specify the distribution of the predictor event per arm given the uncensored endpoint value for a patient.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image31.png){#fig-ttepredgiveneventrate}

Multiple profiles can be defined. To simulate predictor event endpoint
given the event rate of the primary event, the predictor values are
simulated by drawing from the Exponential distribution with rate given
by ($\lambda_{z}\exp(\ \beta Y)$), where $\lambda_z$ and $\beta$ are specified here
and $Y$ is the subject's time to event (in weeks). A single set of values
for $\lambda_z$ and $\beta$ can be specified, or separate values per treatment arm
can be specified.

The arm specific hazard ratios of the predictor given the final endpoint
event rate of a specified scenario is shown in the plot at the bottom of
the predictor tab. The final endpoint scenario can be changed using the
dropdown boxes the right of the figure.

## External

As well as simulating subject responses with predictors within FACTS they can be
simulated externally and imported into
FACTS where the supplied responses are sampled from when simulating the
trial. The specification of a file containing subject response data
(which must be in the required format) can be done from the External
Files sub-tab depicted below (Figure 6‑13).

To import an external file, the user must first add a profile to the
table. After adding the profile, the user must click "Browse" to locate
the file of externally simulated data. The user will then be prompted to
locate the external file on their computer with a dialog box.

![The external files sub-tab for uploading patient data to be sampled from.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image32.png){#fig-externalfiles2}

### Required Format of Externally Simulated Detail

The supplied data should have the following columns:

1)  Patient id, these must be positive integers and unique

2)  Arm Index (1 = Control, 2 = Treatment1, 3 = Treatment2, ...)

3)  Uncensored time to event in weeks

4)  Uncensored Predictor value, one of the following depending on the
    predictor type:

    a.  Continuous: "NN.NN" change from baseline

    b.  Dichotomous: 0 for no response, 1 for response

    c.  TTE: uncensored time to event in weeks

**The GUI requires that the file name has a ".dat" suffix. The file need
not have column headers, but if it does the first column name must start
with a pound sign (#).**

The following shows values from an example file with a dichotomous
predictor. Unlike other endpoints there is only one line per subject, as
there is no need to record the subject's state at interim visits.

| #Patient ID | Dose Index | Uncensored Time to Event (weeks) | Uncensored Predictor value |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 8.87 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 9.34 | 0 |
| 3 | 2 | 6.78 | 1 |
| 4 | 2 | 10.23 | 0 |
| 5 | 2 | 9.96 | 0 |
| 6 | 2 | 5.6 | 1 |
| 7 | 1 | 37.01 | 0 |
| 8 | 1 | 28.67 | 0 |
| 9 | 1 | 39.70 | 0 |

In the above, column headers have been included to make it clearer to read but
they are not required.

Simulated subjects will be drawn from this supplied list, with
replacement, to provide the simulated response values.
