|          |         | each dose. (P-value QOIs are reported in the   |

|          |         | on this endpoint, or some fraction of it (EDq) |
|          |         | is always identifiable, so the Ppn(target) for |
|          |         | these QOIs will sum to 1 across the doses.     |
|          |         |                                                |

|          |         | criteria in any MCMC sample so all doses have  |
|          |         | a 0 probability of having a response greater   |
|          |         | than Control (or AC) by the CSD then no dose   |
|          |         | is the MED. So the sum of each Ppn(target) QOI |

### QOI Columns

The QOI columns depend on the QOIs that have been defined for this
design. The columns are grouped in the following order:

Posterior Probabilities The posterior probability for each QOI for each
dose.

Predictive Probabilities The predictive probability for each QOI for
each dose.

P-Values The p-value for each QOI for each dose.

Target Probabilities The probability of being the target for each QOI
for each dose.

Decision QOIs The value of the decision QOI at the target.

Success

Futile A flag for each QOI decision criteria indicating if the decision
QOI was evaluated and compared to a threshold at the interim (weeks
file) or final analysis (simulation file). The flag value is -1 if the
decision QOI was not evaluated, 0 if it did not meet the threshold and 1
if it did.

Success / Futile Combined A flag indicating if the interim or final
analysis determined success or futility taking all the factors defined
for Success/Futility into account: 0 if the conditions were not met, 1
it the conditions were met. If success and futility conditions have been
defined that are not mutually exclusive and both sets of combined
conditions are met, FACTS will pick one of the outcomes as met but not
the other. In order to discourage defining Success and Futility rules
that can both be true FACTS does not guarantee which outcome will be
selected.

## Contents of Simulations_freq\_\<missing\>.csv, Weeks_freq\_\<missing\>.csv

These file contain the frequentist results after an interim analysis
(weeks file) or final analysis (simulations file), apart for the first
column, the columns are the same in the two types of file, and the same
across the different methods for treating missing data.

                        comparison takes into account whether a response
                        represents a subject's condition improving or
                        worsening, so that a positive treatment effect

                          dropped (and there was no follow-up) or the study

## Contents of MCMCNNNNN.csv

The MCMC file if requested for output by the user, contains all the MCMC
samples for the fitted parameters in the design. There is one row per
sample (including the burnin) and the samples from all the analyses in
the simulation are included. The first two columns are the analysis
index and the sample (within analysis) index. The remaining columns are
the parameters whose sample values are being reported, the number and
constituents of these columns are highly variable depending on design of
the statistical analysis.

                         these are fitted per visit (which depends on the

### Contents if using a Dichotomized Continuous variable

These are the same as for the Dichotomous endpoint, but the LM
parameters are for the LM of the continuous response value.

[^1]: Screenshots from earlier versions of FACTS 6 are retained only
    where they are unchanged in FACTS 7.1

[^2]: The doses in the design become linked to many other parameters, if
    dose levels could be edited this could change the effective order of
    doses and keeping the other parameters settings associated with the
    right doses becomes problematic -- in different circumstances the
    user might want values to stay with the particular treatment arm or
    stay with the particular slot in the treatment arm ranking. Forcing
    doses to be deleted and re-entered if their dose level changes

[^3]: Elsewhere in FACTS Core however we still use the overly specific
    term "dose" when the user might be simulating any manner of
    different treatments. Unfortunately the term "dose" became so
    ubiquitous in the user interface, documentation and outputs that it
    will be a lot of work to remove it.

    in days.
