In FACTS Core with a continuous endpoint there are 2 different
ways to specify the virtual subject response:

1.  Explicit specification of the continuous endpoint

2.  Importation of an externally generated set of simulated subject
    results.

# Explicitly Defined Continuous Response

Explicitly defined VSRs are the most common type specified in FACTS. In
continuous endpoint designs, an explicitly defined VSR is specified by providing
a mean response and patient level standard deviation of the response
for each arm in the trial. In certain cases, based on the selections made in the
Study Info tab, baseline VSRs and Longitudinal VSRs may also need to be specified.

## Dose Response

![](../coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image21.png){}

Dose response profiles can be added and deleted, and for each profile
the user specifies:

1.  The mean response for each treatment arm. If
    baseline is being simulated the user can select (on the Study tab) whether the response
    to be analyzed is <span class="custom-tooltip"> the change from baseline or absolute response <span class="tooltip-text">The
    mean response to be analyzed is
    always as specified on this tab, if the analysis is on change from
    baseline then the response specified here is change from baseline,
    if the response to be analyzed is absolute, then the response
    specified here is the absolute final score.</span> </span>, and depending on that selection
    the response specified on this tab is either change from baseline or
    absolute response.

2.  The standard deviation of the response -- either through a common SD
    of response for all treatment arms, or by specifying the standard
    deviation for the response on each treatment arm separately.

3.  A check box that allows the user to specify whether a specific arm
    "should succeed" in that scenario.FACTS uses this value to report on the
    proportion of simulations that were successful **and** selected a 'good'
    treatment arm. The check box values do not effect the simulation code, just
    how output is reported.

The graph on the Explicitly Defined > Dose Response tab shows the mean response
specified for each treatment arm +/- 1.96 SD, and the control response + the default <span class="custom-tooltip"> CSD <span class="tooltip-text">Clinically significant difference</span> </span> level specified on the QOI tab.

If a 2D treatment arm model is being used, the doses are listed in
"effective dose strength order" as was defined on the treatment arm tab.

![](../coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image22.png){}

#### Load Scenario Means From File

If the "Load scenario means from a file" option is selected, then in
scenarios using this profile the simulations will use a range of dose
responses instead of what is specified in the table.

Each individual simulation uses one set of mean responses from the
supplied file, each row being used in an equal number of simulations.
The summary results are thus averaged over all the VSRs in the file. The
use of this form of simulation is somewhat different from simulations
using a single rate or single external virtual subject response file.
When all the simulations are simulated from a single version of the
'truth' then the purpose of the simulations is to analyse the
performance of the design under that specific circumstance. When the
simulations are based on a range of 'truths' then the summary results
show the expected probability of the different outcomes for the trial
over that range of possible circumstance. Note that, to give different
VSRs different weights of expectation, the more likely VSRs should be
repeated within the file.

![](../coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image23.png){}

After selecting the ".mvsr" file the graph shows the individual mean
responses and the overall mean response over all the VSRs.

The format of the file is a simple CSV text file. Lines starting with a
'#' character are ignored so the file can include comment and header
lines. There must be two columns per treatment arm giving the mean and
SD of the change from baseline on each arm, the columns must be grouped
first means then SDs and within each group they must be in dose index
order. E.g.:

```
#Cntrl, D1, D2, D3, Cntrl, D1, D2, D3
-1, -1, -1, -1, 5, 5, 5, 5
-1, -1.2, -1.4, -1.6, 5, 5, 5, 5
-1, -1.8, -2.5, -2.5, 5, 5, 5, 5
-1, -2, -2.5, -3, 5, 5, 5, 5
-1, -2.5, -3.25, -3.25, 5, 5, 5, 5
-1, -2.5, -3.25, -2.5, 5, 5, 5, 5
```

## Longitudinal VSR

The explicitly defined virtual subject longitudinal responses can be
specified with any of 3 methods. No matter which longitudinal VSR simulation
method is selected, it can be combined with any Dose Response VSR, and the
dose response VSR is <span class="custom-tooltip"> guaranteed to have the marginal distribution <span class="tooltip-text">Unless
Use Baseline Adjustment for Subject Response is specified in the Baseline VSR tab.</span> </span> specified
in the dose response VSR section. The longitudinal VSR determines how to
correlate early endpoint values with the final endpoint value.

The three longitudinal VSRs available for continuous endpoints are:

1.  Correlated

2.  Hierarchical, which comes in two 'flavors':

    a.  Hierarchical (as in versions of FACTS prior to 6.1): the per
        subject random element 'delta' is scaled at visit 't' by the
        response fraction f~t~ at that visit.

    b.  Hierarchical MMRM (first available in FACTS 6.1): the per subject random
        element 'delta' is the same at all visits.

3.  ITP

### Correlated Simulation of Longitudinal Data

The *Correlated* method for generating longitudinal responses simulates
the response observed at each visit by summing 3 elements -- a fraction
of the final response, a fraction of the 'noise' from the previous
observation, and additional element of noise at the current visit.

![](../coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image24.png){}

The user specifies:

$\rho_{t}$
: the correlation in the observation at visit $t$ with visit
$t - 1$. Values should be in the range 0-1. The closer to 1, the
greater the correlation between visit $t - 1$ and visit $t$. The $\rho$ at
Visit 1 is not enterable, because there is no previous visit to correlate the
first visit value with.

$f_{t}$
: the fraction of the final mean response $\mu_{j}$ seen at
visit $t$. Values can lie outside the range 0-1.

$\varphi_{t}^{2}$
: the fraction of the final standard deviation (SD)
that will be observed at this visit. Values must be $>0$. An additional
element of noise at visit $t$ is sampled so that in combination with
the noise carried forward from visit $t - 1$, the overall variance in
observations at visit $t$ will have this fraction of the final
variance.

For the first visit of patient $i$, the response $y_{i,1}$ assuming
patient $i$ was randomized to dose $j$ is simulated as:

$$y_{i,1}\ \sim\ N\left( \mu_{j,1},\sigma_{j,1}^{2} \right)$$

For time points after the first visit, observed data is simulated as:

$$y_{i,t}\ \sim\ \mu_{j,t} + \sqrt{1 - \rho_{t}^{2}}N\left( 0,\sigma_{j,t}^{2} \right) + \rho_{t}\left( y_{i,t - 1} - \mu_{j,t - 1} \right)\frac{\sigma_{j,t}}{\sigma_{j,t - 1}} \text{   for } t \geq 2.$$

There are 3 components of this equation. First, is the marginal mean of
the response at the particular visit $t$. This parameter is called
$\mu_{j,t}$. $\mu_{j,t}$ is simply the dose response at the final
endpoint times the proportion of the final effect that should be
observed at visit $t$.

$$\mu_{j,t} = f_{t}\mu_{j}$$

where $f_{t}$ is input as the response fraction for each visit, and
$\mu_{j}$ is the dose response for dose $j$, which is input as the
Response for each dose on the Dose Response tab.

The second component controls the adjustment of the variance based on
the correlation of the endpoint to be sampled with the previous visit's
response. A strong correlation ($\rho_{t}$ close to $\pm 1$) results in
a variance reduction term $\sqrt{1 - \rho_{t}^{2}}$ close to 0, which
guarantees that the time $t$ response is very close to the time $t - 1$
response. The variance reduction term modifies a dose's marginal visit
variance $\sigma_{j,t}^{2}$. This dose by visit variance is
calculated by squaring the marginal standard deviation for a dose's
final endpoint response $\sigma_{j}$ times the proportion of the total
variance that is observed at visit $t$, $\phi_{t}$, which is a user
input on the Longitudinal VSR tab.

So, $\sigma_{j,t}^{2} = \phi_{t}^{2}\sigma_{j}^{2}$ where $\phi_{t}$ is
the fraction of final SD specified in the Longitudinal VSR tab in FACTS,
and $\sigma_{j}$ is the SD of the response specified in the Dose
Response VSR tab in FACTS.

The final component of the model adjusts the mean of the visit $t$
response that is to be simulated based on the residual of the time
$t - 1$ response. This component is:

$$\rho_{t}\left( y_{i,t - 1} - \mu_{j,t - 1} \right)\frac{\sigma_{j,t}}{\sigma_{j,t - 1}}$$

Values of $\rho_{t}$ close to 1 lead to visit $t$ responses with
Z-scores similar to the visit $t - 1$ responses, values of $\rho_{t}$
close to 0 lead to simulation of visit $t$ responses with no regard to
the previous visit's residual value, and values of $\rho_{t}$ close to
-1 lead to visit $t$ responses with Z-scores that are -1 times the
previous visit's Z-score.

The specification of the visit level means $\mu_{j,t}\ $and variances
$\sigma_{j,t}^{2}$ as response fractions and fractions of final SD,
respectively, allows for each created longitudinal VSR to work with
every created Dose Response VSR.

### Hierarchical model

The hierarchical method for generating longitudinal responses simulates
the response observed by sampling responses from a Normal distribution,
where the mean is a combination of the mean final response of the
treatment and a per-subject difference, scaled by a visit
dependent coefficient, and the variance is a fraction of the variance of
the final treatment effect.

This Hierarchical form of this model has a per-subject random
effect parameter $\delta_{i}$ that is scaled down by the response
scaling parameter $f_{t}$. In the very similar Hierarchical (MMRM) model
(described below), the random effect $\delta_{i}$ is not scaled by
$f_{t}$, so it provides a constant adjustment to all visits.

![](../coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image25.png){}

In the Hierarchical longitudinal subject data simulation model, the response
variance is decomposed into two components. One is the within-subject variability
(called intra-subject variability), and the other is across-subject variability
(Called inter-subject variability). The parameter $\omega$ determines
how much of the total variability is simulated in the inter- and intra-subject
variabilities. More variability in the inter-subject simulation means that there is
less variability in the intra-subject simulation, so the early visit endpoints will be
more correlated with the final visit endpoint, and vice versa.

The parameters of the Hierarchical longitudinal subject data simulation model are:

$\omega$
: the fraction of the variance of the final response ($\sigma_{j}^{2}$) on the
treatment arm that will be simulated in the inter-subject variance. The
higher this value is, the more predictive a subject's early
observations are of their final outcome.

$f_{t}$
: the fraction of the final mean response $\mu_{j}$ seen at
visit $t$. Values can lie outside the range 0-1.

$\phi_{jt}^{2}$
: the fraction of the final endpoint variance that will be observed at this visit. Values
must be $>0$ and must be such that $\phi_{jt}^{2} - f_{t}^{2}\omega$ is
$>0$.

Observation $y_{it}$ is the visit response at visit $t$ for a subject
$i$ that was randomized from dose $j$. The observation is generated from
the distribution described by:

$$y_{i,t} = f_{t}\left( \mu_{j} + \delta_{i} \right) + N\left( {0,\ \left( \phi_{jt}^{2} - f_{t}^{2}\omega \right)\ \sigma}_{j}^{2} \right)$$

where $\sigma_{j}^{2}$ is the variance of the final endpoint response
for dose $j$, $\phi_{jt}^{2}$ is the fraction of total variance observed
at visit $t$ on dose $j$, $\mu_{j}$ is the final endpoint response mean
for dose $j$, $\delta_{i}$ is a subject level random effect, $f_{t}$ is
the fraction of the final endpoint response that is observed at visit
$t$, and $\omega$ is the proportion of overall variance due to
intersubject (across subject) variability.

The prior for the patient random effect term of patient $i$ who was
randomized to dose $j$ is

$$\delta_{ij}\ \sim\ N\left( 0,\ \omega\sigma_{j}^{2} \right)$$

If $\omega$ is close to 1, then most of the variability in the responses
comes from differences in participants and the visit-to-visit
correlation within a participant's follow-up is high. If $\omega$ is
close to 0, then there is little correlation between visits within a
participant's follow-up, and most of the overall variance comes from
noise in the within patient responses, rather than differences across
patients. In other words, large values of $\omega$ lead to early data
that is more predictive of the final endpoint.

Note that, in this model the response fraction $f_{t}$ is multiplied by
both the final endpoint mean and the patient level random effect. This
results in the variance of the dose $j$ response at visit $t$
being
$${\left( \phi_{jt}^{2} - f_{t}^{2}\omega \right)\sigma}_{j}^{2} + f_{t}^{2}\omega\sigma_{j}^{2} = \phi_{jt}^{2}\sigma_{j}^{2}.$$

Additionally, since $f_{t}$ changes the proportion of the overall
variance that comes from the random effect, the simulated correlation
between visits decreases when values of $f_{t}$ less than 1 are
provided. See the MMRM version of the Hierarchical simulation model if
this is undesirable.

If all $\phi_{jt}^{2} = 1$ and $f_{t} = 1$, then the visits will have
pairwise correlations equal to $\omega$. If the $\phi_{jt}^{2}$ or
$f_{t}$ are less than 1, then the visit pairwise correlations will
depend on the input variance fractions $\phi_{jt}^{2}$ and $f_{t}$.

### Hierarchical (MMRM) model

The Hierarchical (MMRM) longitudinal patient simulation model is very
similar to the Hierarchical simulation method, except that in the MMRM
version the response fraction for a visit does not modify the patient
level random effect. The user inputs for the Hierarchical (MMRM) model
are nearly identical to the plain Hierarchical model.

$\omega$
: the fraction of the variance of the final response on the
treatment arm ($\sigma_{j}^{2}$) that will be simulated in the
inter-subject variance. The higher this value is, the more predictive
a subject's early observations are of their final outcome.

$f_{t}$
: the fraction of the final mean response $\mu_{j}$ seen at
visit $t$. Values can lie outside the range 0-1.

$\phi_{jt}^{2}$
: the fraction of the final endpoint variance that will be observed at this visit for
dose $j$, values must be \>0 and must be such that
$\phi_{jt}^{2} - \omega$ \> 0.

The Hierarchical MMRM method simulates responses at visit $t$ for a
subject $i$ that was randomized to dose $j$ from the distribution:

$$y_{i,t} = f_{t}\mu_{j} + \delta_{i} + N\left(0,\ \left( \phi_{jt}^{2} - \omega \right)\ \sigma_{j}^{2} \right)$$.

where $\sigma_{j}^{2}$ is the variance of the final endpoint response
for dose $j$, $\phi_{jt}^{2}$ is the fraction of total variance observed
at visit $t$ on dose $j$, $\mu_{j}$ is the final endpoint response mean
for dose $j$, $\delta_{i}$ is a subject level random effect, $f_{t}$ is
the fraction of the final endpoint response that is observed at visit
$t$, and $\omega$ is the proportion of overall variance due to
intersubject (across subject) variability.

The prior for the patient random effect term of patient $i$ who was
randomized to dose $j$ is

$$\delta_{ij}\ \sim\ N\left( 0,\ \omega\sigma_{j}^{2} \right)$$

If $\omega$ is close to 1, then most of the variability in the responses
comes from differences in participants and the visit-to-visit
correlation within a participant's follow-up is high. If $\omega$ is
close to 0, then there is little correlation between visits within a
participant's follow-up, and most of the overall variance comes from
noise in the within patient responses rather than differences across
patients. In other words, large values of $\omega$ lead to early data
that is more predictive of the final endpoint.

Note that, in this model the response fraction $f_{t}$ is multiplied by
only the final endpoint mean and not the patient level random effect.
This results in the variance of the dose $j$ response at visit $t$
being
$${\left( \phi_{jt}^{2} - \omega \right)\sigma}_{j}^{2} + \omega\sigma_{j}^{2} = \phi_{jt}^{2}\sigma_{j}^{2}.$$

This total variance is the same as the non MMRM Hierarchical method, but
only the $\phi_{jt}^{2}$ parameter effects the variance of early
endpoint responses. If all $\phi_{jt}^{2} = 1$, then the visits will
have pairwise correlations equal to $\omega$. If the $\phi_{jt}^{2}$ are
less than 1, then the visit pairwise correlations will be larger than
$\omega$, with the exact value depending on the input variance fractions
$\phi_{jt}^{2}$.

### Integrated Two Component Prediction (ITP) Simulation of Longitudinal Data

The ITP method for generating longitudinal responses simulates the
response observed at each visit by summing 3 elements and scaling them
by an exponential function. The 3 elements are: the mean final response,
an element of inter-subject variability, and a residual variability at
the current visit.

![](../coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image26.png){}

The user specifies

$\omega_{j}$
: fraction (for each dose) of the variance of the final
response on the treatment arm ($\sigma_{j}^{2}$) used for the inter-subject
variance. The higher this value is, the more predictive a subject's
early observations are of their final outcome.

$k_{j}$
: the shape parameter (for each dose) of the exponential
component governing the increase in the observed response. The values
of $k$ should be scaled to take into account the length of time (in
weeks) to the intermediate and final visits. See below for more
intuition on sensible values of $k$.

For subject $i$ at visit $t$, who was randomized to dose $j$, the
response $y_{it}$ is simulated as:

$$y_{it} = \left( \mu_{j} + s_{i} + \epsilon_{it} \right)\left( \frac{1 - \text{exp}\left( k_{j}x_{t} \right)}{1 - \text{exp}\left( k_{j}x_{T} \right)} \right)$$

where $\mu_{j}$ is the mean of the final endpoint on dose $j$,
$s_{i}\sim N\left( 0,\ \omega_{j}\sigma_{j}^{2} \right)$ is a subject
specific random effect, each
$\epsilon_{it}\sim N\left( 0,{\ \sigma}_{j}^{2}\left( 1 - \omega_{j} \right) \right)$
is a residual error, $k_{d}$ is a shape parameter, $x_{t}$ are the visit
times that the $y_{it}$ are observed, and $x_{T}$ is the time of the
final endpoint.

The ITP model implies that the variance of the observations shrinks
towards 0 with the mean (so early visits have reduced expected responses
and variances).

The shape parameter $k$ determines the rate at which the final
endpoint's eventual effect is observed during a subject's follow-up. A
value of $k = 0$ indicates that the proportion of effect observed moves
linearly with time. A value of $k < 0$ means that the eventual final
effect is observed earlier in follow-up and plateaus off as time moves
towards the final endpoint. A value of $k > 0$ indicates that less of
the total final endpoint effect is observed early in follow up, but as
time approaches the final endpoint time the proportion of the effect
observed increases rapidly. Values of $k$ less than 0 tend to be more
common than values of $k$ greater than 0. See the figure below for a
collection of possible shapes of the change in response using different
values of $k$.

Additionally, unlike the Correlated or Hierarchical simulation methods,
the ITP method uses the actual visit time to simulate subject values.

![](../coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image27.png){}

## Baseline VSR

If simulation of baseline has been included on the Study > Study Info
tab, a new virtual subject response tab is available for specifying the
baseline score.

![](../coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image28.png){}

The simulation of distribution of baseline scores is specified using a
normal distribution with user specified mean and standard deviation,
and optionally applied upper and lower bounds to reflect limitations on
the score range or screening criteria. If the simulated
baseline score is truncated, then the ***true*** mean and SD of the
baseline are likely to be different from these values of the mean and SD
which are before truncation.

If the response is chosen to be change from baseline on the Study Info tab,
then the dose response VSR is specified as change from baseline, and the raw
endpoint for a subject will actually be their baseline value plus their
simulated change from baseline value. If the response is chosen to be Final
endpoint value on the Study Info tab, then the dose response VSR specifies
the direct distribution that the final endpoint will be sampled from, and
changing the baseline distribution does not effect the final endpoint distribution.

Whether the final endpoint is change from baseline or final endpoint value, it
is possible to adjust the final response based on the simulated baseline value.
To do so, the user selects "Use Baseline Adjustment for Subject Response" and
supplies 3 parameters:

$\beta$
: a coefficient that reflects the degree of influence of
baseline on final score and the degree of variability in the final
score due to baseline.

c
: a centering offset, typically the expected mean of the observed
baseline scores

s
: a scaling element, typically set to the expected SD of the
baseline.

Be aware that performing a baseline adjustment for subject response can
change the marginal distribution of the dose response VSR.

##### Example

In the above screenshot a baseline of mean 25 and SD 10 has
been specified for the distribution of the baseline values, so a centering of $c=25$ and scaling of $s=10$ is used.
Wishing to simulate an overall SD of 5 in the final change from baseline
and apportion two-thirds the variance to baseline, $\beta$ has been set as
follows:

-   The desired final variance is 25 ($5^2$), divided into 1/3
    dose response and 2/3 baseline effects.

-   The SD of the simulated response is set to $\sqrt{\left( 25*\frac{1}{3} \right)} = 2.89$

-   The SD of the scaled baseline score is 1, so to contribute half the
    final variance of 25, Beta is set to $\sqrt{\left( 25*\frac{2}{3} \right)} = 4.08$

-   Note that when simulating a baseline effect in this way, limiting
    the range of baseline by specifying upper and lower cut-offs --
    which might be natural limits of the endpoint, or due to inclusion /
    exclusion criteria in the protocol -- can significantly reduce the
    variance in the final endpoint due to the baseline effect.

# External Files VSR

As well as simulating subject responses within FACTS they can be
simulated externally, and imported into
FACTS where the supplied responses are sampled from when simulating the
trial. The selection of a file containing subject response data (which
must be in the required format) can be done from the External Files
sub-tab depicted below.

To import an external file, the user must first add a profile to the
table. After adding the profile, the user must click "Browse" to locate
the file of externally simulated data. The user will then be prompted to
locate the external file on their computer with a dialog box.

As with other virtual subject responses, the user can specify which arms
"should succeed" at the bottom of the tab.

![](../coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image29.png){}

### Required Format of Externally Simulated Detail

The supplied data should be in the following format: an ascii file with
data in comma separated value format with the following columns:

1)  Patient id, these must be positive integers and unique

2)  Arm Index (1 = Control, 2 = Treatment1, 3 = Treatment2, ...)

3)  Visit ID -- visit index (1= first visit, 2= second visit, ...). If
    baseline is included, then baseline is visit 0.

4)  Response

    a.  If no baseline is included, then the response provided must
        be change from baseline

    b.  If baseline is included, then the response provided must be the
        absolute response (and the design engine will compute change
        from baseline or analyze the absolute response as specified by
        the user on the Study tab).

Subjects need to have unique, positive integer IDs, all records for each
subject should be contiguous and in visit order.

The GUI requires that the file name has a ".dat" suffix.

Below are two examples of files providing externally simulated patient data
for 3 subjects with 4 post baseline visits. The left side of the table shows
an example file for a trial that does not simulate the baseline value, and
the right panel shows an example file for a trial that does simulate the
baseline visit.

: Figure 3‑1: Two example external files providing externally simulated patient data. Note the pound sign to begin the header line, which indicates that it is ignored.

### External Directory of Files

By using the 'Browse for directory' option, the user can specify a
response profile that comprises a directory containing a number of
external response files. Like the "scenario means in a file" option, the
files in this directory will be used as a single profile, looping
through the different files for successive simulations. So individual
simulations will use a single external file from the directory, but the
summary results for the scenario will be averaged over all the files,
the number of simulations being round down to the nearest multiple of
the number of external files in the directory. The format of each
individual file should be the same as for a single external file, above.
Only files with the ".dat" suffix will be read, other files will be
ignored.
