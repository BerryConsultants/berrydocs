In FACTS Core with a dichotomous endpoint there are 4 different
ways to specify the virtual subject response:

1.  Explicit specification of a dichotomous endpoint

2.  Explicit specification of a restricted Markov endpoint

3.  Explicit specification of a continuous endpoint that is dichotomized
    into responder / non-responder based on the response at the final
    visit.

4.  Importation of an externally generated set of simulated subject
    results.

# Explicitly Defined Dichotomous Response

Explicitly defined VSRs are the most common type specified in FACTS. In
dichotomous endpoint designs, an explicitly defined VSR is specified by providing
a response rate for each arm in the trial. The dichotomous final outcome will
be simulated having the desired response rate, and longitudinal correlation can
be simulated connecting subjects' intermediate endpoints to the final endpoint.

## Dose Response

![The Explicitly Defined > Dose Response model for a dichotomous endpoint.](../coreUGattachments/dichotomous/media/image20.png){#fig-expdrd}

Dose response profiles can be added and deleted, and for each profile
the user specifies:

1.  The response rate for each treatment arm.

2.  A check box that allows the user to specify whether a specific arm
    "should succeed" in that scenario: so that FACTS can report on the
    proportion of simulations that were successful **and** a 'good'
    treatment arm selected.

The graph on the tab shows the mean response rate specified and the
target.

If a 2D treatment arm model is being used, the doses are listed in
"effective dose strength order" as was defined on the treatment arm tab.

#### Load Scenario Rates From File

If the "Load scenario means from a file" option is selected then in
scenarios using this profile the simulations will use a range of dose
responses. Each individual simulation uses one set of response rates
from the supplied file, each row being used in an equal number of
simulations. The summary results are thus averaged over all the VSRs in
the file. The use of this form of simulation is somewhat different from
simulations using a single rate or single external virtual subject
response file. When all the simulations are simulated from one 'truth'
then the purpose of the simulations is to analyse the performance of the
design under that specific circumstance. When the simulations are based
on a range of 'truths' then the summary results show the expected
probability of the different outcomes for the trial over that range of
possible circumstances. Note that to give different VSRs different
weights of expectation, the more likely VSRs should be repeated within
the file.

![The Explicitly Defined > Dose Response tab when loading scenario means from a file.](../coreUGattachments/dichotomous/media/image21.png){#fig-expmeansfromfiledich}

After selecting the ".mvsr" file the graph shows the individual response
rates and the mean response rate over all the VSRs.

There is a check box per dose that allows the user to specify whether a
specific arm "should succeed" in that scenario: so that FACTS can report
on the proportion of simulations that were successful **and** a 'good'
treatment arm selected.

The format of the ".mvsr" file is a simple CSV text file. Lines starting
with a '#' character are ignored, so the file can include comment and
header lines. There must be one column per treatment arm, and they must
be in dose index order. Each value is the underlying response rate to
simulate. E.g.:

```
#Cntrl, D1, D2, D3, D4
0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.25, 0.5
0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.23, 0.45
0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.21, 0.4
0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.19, 0.35
0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.17, 0.3
0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.15, 0.25
```

## Longitudinal

The tab for defining dichotomous longitudinal response profiles allows
the user to specify the overall transition probabilities between
responder and non-responder.

If no special longitudinal options are selected on the Study Info page, then
this default simulation method that uses transition probabilities to simulate
sequential dichotomous endpoints is used.

The transition probabilities method for generating longitudinal
responses simulates the response observed at each visit by using the
probability that a subject becomes or remains a '1' from one visit to
the next -- and all subjects start with a response of 0.

![The dichotomous endpoint Longitudinal VSR tab.](../coreUGattachments/dichotomous/media/image22.png){#fig-longdich}

The user specifies for each visit,

-   the probability of a subject whose response was a '0' at the
    previous visit having a response of '1' at this visit

-   the probability of a subject whose response was a '1' at the
    previous visit having a response of '1' at this visit

However, these probabilities imply a particular probability that a
subject has a response of '1' at the final visit, so they need to be
modified for each arm in each dose response profile to give the desired
final probability of response. This is done by numerically determining
for each final response rate, a single value which when
added to all the specified transition probabilities in the log-odds
space yield the desired probability of final response.

Let $Q_{td}$ be the probability of transitioning from 0 to 1, and
$R_{td}$ be the probability of transitioning from 1 to 1 for each visit
(t) and dose (d).

For the 1^st^ visit:

$$P\left( y_{1d} = 1 \right) = Q_{1d}$$

which is like considering the imaginary 0^th^ visit to have been a non-response.
For subsequent visits:

$$P\left( y_{td} = 1 \middle| y_{t - 1,d} = 0 \right) = Q_{td}$$

$$P\left( y_{td} = 1 \middle| y_{t - 1,d} = 1 \right) = R_{td}$$

The dose response ($P_{d}$) is first specified in the VSR \> Explicitly
Defined \> Dose Response tab, and then longitudinal components ($q_{t}$
and $r_{t}$) are specified separately. FACTS then makes an adjustment to
the longitudinal components $q_{t}$ and $r_{t}$ to calculate $Q_{td}$
and $R_{td}$ for each dose while maintaining the value for $P_{d}$
specified in the Dose Response tab.

The matrices Q and R are calculated by applying offsets $f_{d}$ in log
odds space to the longitudinal values:

$$Q_{t,d} = \frac{e^{q'_{td}}}{1 + e^{q'_{td}}}, \ \ q'_{td} = \ln\left( \frac{q_{t}}{1 + q_{t}} \right) + f_{d}$$

$$R_{t,d} = \frac{e^{r'_{td}}}{1 + e^{r'_{td}}}, \ \ r'_{td} = \ln\left( \frac{r_{t}}{1 + r_{t}} \right) + f_{d}$$

where $f_{d}$ is calculated iteratively for each dose to ensure that Q
and R give the correct final probability of response for each dose. As a
result,

$$P_{d} = x_{Td}$$

where

$$x_{1d} = Q_{1d}$$

and

$$x_{t} = x_{t - 1}R_{td} + \left( 1 - x_{t - 1} \right)Q_{td}$$

##### Example

With 3 visits and probabilities of $0\rightarrow 1$ of $0.2$ and of $1\rightarrow 1$ of $0.9$ at
each visit, the probability of a final response is 0.438. This 0.438 is fixed,
and cannot be changed without changing the transition probabilities.

| Index | Visit | Prob [1 $\rightarrow$ 1]{.nobreak} \
[($r_t$)]{.nobreak} | Prob [0 $\rightarrow$ 1]{.nobreak} \
[($q_t$)]{.nobreak} | Cumulative Pr(Resp) |
|------|------|:------:|:------:|-------------------------|
| 1 | Visit 1 |     | $0.2$ | $0.2$ |
| 2 | Visit 2 | $0.9$ | $0.2$ | $0.2*0.9$ $+\;(1-0.2)*0.2$ $= 0.34$ |
| 3 | Visit 3 | $0.9$ | $0.2$ | $0.34*0.9$ $+\;(1-0.34)*0.2$ $= 0.438$ |

If a response profile calls for the probability of a final response to
be simulated with a probability of 0.8, a fixed offset in log-odds is
found which, when applied to all the transition probabilities, results in
the desired final probability of a response. Replicating this by hand to
an accuracy of 4 significant digits yields an offset of $f_d = 1.173$, which gives:

$$\text{logit}^{-1}(\text{logit}(0.2) + 1.173) = 0.4469$$
$$\text{logit}^{-1}(\text{logit}(0.9) + 1.173) = 0.9668$$

Then,

| Index | Visit | Prob [1 $\rightarrow$ 1]{.nobreak}\
[($r_t$)]{.nobreak} | Prob [0 $\rightarrow$ 1]{.nobreak}\
[($q_t$)]{.nobreak} | Cumulative Pr(Resp) |
|------|------|:------:|:------:|-------------------------|
| 1 | Visit 1 |          | $0.4469$ | $0.4469$ |
| 2 | Visit 2 | $0.9668$ | $0.4469$ | $0.4469*0.9668$ $+ (1-0.4469)*0.4469$ $= 0.6792$ |
| 3 | Visit 3 | $0.9668$ | $0.4469$ | $0.6792*0.9668$ $+ (1-0.6792)*0.4469$ $= 0.8000$ |

# Explicitly Defined Restricted Markov model

If on the Study > Study Info tab, the special longitudinal option of
using the restricted Markov is selected then this tab is available for
specifying jointly how subject interim and final outcomes are to be
simulated:

![The Virtual Subject Response > Explicitly Defined tab when specifying an endpoint VSR using the restricted Markov model. This tab creates the components for the dose response and longitudinal aspects of the VSR.](../coreUGattachments/dichotomous/media/image23.png){#fig-longrmm}

Unlike the simulation of the conventional dichotomous outcome, with
Restricted Markov the longitudinal and final response are specified
together.

The Absorbing Markov Chain model assumes at each visit patients are in
one of three states -- responder, stable disease, or failure
(non-responder). The responder and failure states are assumed to be
absorbing, so patients entering one of these states remain in those
states for the duration of the study. Thus, all patient profiles will
consist of some duration of stable disease followed by a permanent
transition to responder or failure. If a subject remains in the stable state
through their final endpoint time, the final response is made
dichotomous by the user specifying whether patients in the stable state
at the final visit should be classified as responders or failures.

For each dose the user specifies the probability that the subject will
be a failure at their final endpoint, and the probability that a subject
will be a responder at their final visit. Given these probabilities,
FACTS can calculate the probability that a subjects is in the stable
state at their final visit, and then the mechanism for generating
subjects longitudinal data is:

1)  Two independent exponentially distributed variables, one measuring
    the time until response $T_{R}$ and another measuring the time until
    failure $T_{F}$, are simulated when the subject enters the study.

2)  If either of variable has a value less than the final endpoint time,
    the engine determines which variable ($T_{R}$ or $T_{F}$) is the
    minimum. All visits whose time occurs less than that minimum are
    stable, while all visits past that variable's time are classified as
    that variable's corresponding state (thus, if visits occur every
    week for 10 weeks, the response variable $T_{R}$ is 4.5, and the
    failure variable $T_{F}$ is 9.5, then the response variable is the
    minimum, visits 1-4 are stable, and visits 5-10 are a response.

3)  If neither variable is less than the final endpoint time, the final
    endpoint and all visits are assumed to be stable.

The parameters of the exponential variables are determined so that they
agree with the user entries for the probabilities of response, stable,
and failure at the final endpoint. Given T is the time of the final
endpoint and a particular dose has probability for response, stable, and
failure of Pr(resp), Pr(stable), and Pr(fail) with Pr(stable) strictly
between 0 and 1, the appropriate exponential parameters (again there are
separate rates in each group and arm) are

$$\lambda_{r} = \frac{\Pr(resp)\left\lbrack - \ln{Pr(stable)} \right\rbrack}{T\left( 1 - Pr(stable) \right)}$$
$$\lambda_{f} = \frac{\Pr(fail)\left\lbrack - \ln{Pr(stable)} \right\rbrack}{T\left( 1 - Pr(stable) \right)}$$

If one of these rates is 0, that random variable is removed from the
calculation (e.g. if Pr(fail)=0 then failures are not generated). If
Pr(stable)=0, the transition to response or failure is assumed to occur
instantaneously after enrolment, and thus a weighted coin is flipped
with probabilities Pr(resp) and Pr(fail) and all visits are equal to the
result (e.g. all visits are responses or all visits are failures
depending on the result of that weighted coin flip). If Pr(stable)=1,
then all visits are stable.

There is a check box per dose that allows the user to specify whether a
specific arm "should succeed" in that scenario so that FACTS can report
on the proportion of simulations that were successful **and** a 'good'
treatment arm selected.

The graph on the Restricted Markov tab shows the probability of response
for each arm and the target CSD relative to the response on control.

#### Load Scenario Means From File

If restricted Markov is being used, then there must be two sets of
columns in the .mvsr column. The first half of the columns gives the overall response rate for each arm,
and the second half of columns give the overall failure rate per arm. For example, to specify VSR's for the restricted Markov model with varying response rates and failure rates constant at 0.1:

```
#Cntrl, 1mg, 5mg, 10mg, 25mg, 50mg, 100mg, Cntrl, 1mg, 5mg, 10mg, 25mg,
50mg, 100mg
0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1
0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.17, 0.15, 0.12, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1
0.2, 0.21, 0.22, 0.23, 0.25, 0.27, 0.28, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1,
0.1
0.2, 0.22, 0.22, 0.27, 0.3, 0.32, 0.35, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1,
0.1
0.2, 0.22, 0.24, 0.28, 0.35, 0.4, 0.4, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1
0.2, 0.22, 0.25, 0.35, 0.4, 0.35, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1
0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.35, 0.3, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1
```

# Explicitly Defined Dichotomized Continuous Response

If, on the Study > Study Info tab, the special longitudinal option is
selected that the endpoint is a dichotomized continuous response, then instead
of using the dichotomous endpoint infrastructure the [continuous dose response
model](../design/doseresponse.qmd) and
[longitudinal data simulation](../longitudinalmodels/continuous.qmd) tabs are
used. After the final endpoint
and all intermediate endpothey are dichotomized using the threshold specified on the Study Info tab.
ints are simulated from the continuous distribution,

#### Load Scenario Means From File

If a dichotomized continuous endpoint is being used then there must be
two sets of columns, the first giving the mean change from baseline and
the second giving the SD of the change (as in FACTS Core Continuous).
For example, with control and 3 doses, and where the SD will be 5 for all
doses in all VSRs:

```
#Means SDs
#Cntrl, D1, D2, D3, Cntrl, D1, D2, D3
-1, -1, -1, -1, 5, 5, 5, 5
-1, -1.2, -1.4, -1.6, 5, 5, 5, 5
-1, -1.8, -2.5, -2.5, 5, 5, 5, 5
-1, -2, -2.5, -3, 5, 5, 5, 5
-1, -2.5, -3.25, -3.25, 5, 5, 5, 5
-1, -2.5, -3.25, -2.5, 5, 5, 5, 5
```

#  External

As well as simulating subject responses within FACTS they can be
simulated externally, and imported into
FACTS where the supplied responses are sampled from with replacement
when simulating the trial. The selection of a file containing subject
response data (which must be in the required format) can be done from
the External Files sub-tab depicted below. The External Files option is
available if specifying the dichotomous endpoint as restricted Markov,
dichotomized continuous, or without special longitudinal options.

To import an external file, the user must first add a profile to the
table. After adding the profile, the user must click "Browse" to locate
the file of externally simulated data. The user will then be prompted to
locate the external file on their computer with a dialog box.

![The external VSR tab in the Core Dichotomous engine loading a single VSR from a file.](../coreUGattachments/dichotomous/media/image24.png){#fig-extVSRdich}

### Required Format of Externally Simulated Detail

The supplied data should be in the following format: an ascii file with
data in comma separated value format with the following columns:

:::{.panel-tabset}

### Dichotomous

1)  Patient id -- these must be sequential, unique, positive integers.

2)  Arm Index (1 = Control, 2 = Treatment1, 3 = Treatment2, ...)

3)  Visit ID -- visit index (1 = first visit, 2 = second visit, ...)

4)  Response: 0 for no response, 1 for response

### Restricted Markov

1)  Patient id -- these must be sequential, unique, positive integers.

2)  Arm Index (1 = Control, 2 = Treatment1, 3 = Treatment2, ...)

3)  Visit ID -- visit index (1 = first visit, 2 = second visit, ...)

4)  Response: 0 for no response, 1 for response, -1 for stable

### Dichotomized Continuous Response

1)  Patient id - these must be sequential, unique, positive integers.

2)  Arm Index (1 = Control, 2 = Treatment1, 3 = Treatment2, ...)

3)  Visit ID -- visit index (1 = first visit, 2 = second visit, ...)

4)  Response: continuous response that is dichotomized by FACTS

:::

Subjects need to have unique, positive integer IDs, all records for each
subject should be contiguous and in visit order.

The GUI requires that the file name has a ".dat" suffix. Additionally,
it is acceptable to not use column headers in the .dat input file. If
column headers are included, the column header line should begin with a pound
sign (#) indicating it should be ignored.

If continuous-valued response is dichotomized, then the response specified
in the .dat file should be continuous responses that FACTS will then
dichotomize.

##### Example

For 2 subjects, both assigned to the first arm, data for 6
visits could look like any of the following:

:::{.panel-tabset}

### Regular Dichotomous

#subj id, Arm ID, Visit ID, Response

1,1,1,0\
1,1,2,0\
1,1,3,0\
1,1,4,1\
1,1,5,0\
1,1,6,1\
2,1,1,1\
2,1,2,0\
2,1,3,0\
2,1,4,0\
2,1,5,0\
2,1,6,0

### Restricted Markov

#subj id, Arm ID, Visit ID, Response

1,1,1,-1\
1,1,2,-1\
1,1,3,-1\
1,1,4,-1\
1,1,5,-1\
1,1,6,-1\
2,1,1,-1\
2,1,2,-1\
2,1,3,0\
2,1,4,0\
2,1,5,0\
2,1,6,0

### Dichotomized Continuous

#subj id, Arm ID, Visit ID, Response

1,1,1,1.3\
1,1,2,0.1\
1,1,3,-4.25\
1,1,4,3.5\
1,1,5,2.96\
1,1,6,2.3\
2,1,1,1.1\
2,1,2,0.4\
2,1,3,2.99\
2,1,4,1.2\
2,1,5,1.1\
2,1,6,3.1

:::

Note that the first line in each of the tabs contains column names, and that the row
begins with a pound sign (#). This pound sign tells FACTS that it should
not try to read that row in as data.

### External Directory of Files

By using the 'Browse for directory' option, the user can specify a
response profile that comprises a directory containing a number of
external response files. Like the "scenario means in a file" option, the
files in this directory will be used as a single profile, looping
through the different files for successive simulations. So individual
simulations will use a single external file from the directory, but the
summary results for the scenario will be averaged over all the files,
the number of simulations being round down to the nearest multiple of
the number of external files in the directory. The format of each
individual file should be the same as for a single external file, above.
Only files with the ".dat" suffix will be read, other files will be
ignored.
