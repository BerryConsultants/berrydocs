# Analysis

The analysis tab allows the user to supply a specific data set for
analysis by the design specified in the Design tab of the ".facts" file.

![](./coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image79.png){}

Clicking on the "Use Design to Analyze Data" button, will create an
empty "subject.csv" file in the main simulation results directory and an
'Analysis' sub-directory there for running the analysis and saving the
outputs.

Alternatively, clicking on the "Import Data to Analyze" launches a file
browser, allowing the user to select a '.csv' file to load as the data
to analyze. This is a shortcut for first clicking on the "Use Design to
Analyze Data" button, and then clicking on the "Select File to Create
New Analysis" button on the subject data tab.

![](./coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image80.png){}

After enabling data analysis, the analysis screen is shown with no data
loaded. By clicking on the "Subject Data" tab the user is now able to
enter data values directly, or to load a '.csv' file already containing
data:

![](./coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image81.png){}

## Entering the data directly

For a typical FACTS Core trial, there are normally too many subjects to
want to enter the data directly, but it is possible. Also if data is
first loaded from an external file, it is presented in the same grid as
that used for data entry and additional data can be added or existing
data modified.

The data format is the same as the 'patientsNNNN.csv' output file from
simulations, so it is easy to use these as the basis for a trial
analysis.

-   The first column is the Subject ID. FACTS does not use this value,
    it is there to allow the data to be cross-referenced to an external
    data source. If not required there is no harm simply entering '1' on
    each row.

-   Region ID is a value output from FACTS simulation, reflecting the
    recruiting region the simulated subject was recruited in. It is not
    used in analysis, if a region ID is not available there is no harm
    simply entering '1' for each subject.

-   Date is a real number indicating when the subject was recruited in
    weeks[^5] from the start of the trial. It is output from FACTS
    simulation, it is not used in analysis. If a date is not available
    there is no harm simply entering '1' for each subject.

-   Dose index indicates which arm the subject was randomized to. The
    index of each arm is visible on the Study \> Treatment Arms tab.
    Index '1' is the Control arm if a Control is present.

-   Last Visit# is the index of last visit for which there is data for
    the subject. Previously FACTS could not process data with data
    missing from visits before the last visit. From FACTS 6.2 this is
    now possible. Visits for which no data is available should be given
    the value "-9999". Data supplied for a subject's visits after 'Last
    Visit#' is ignored.

-   Dropout, is a flag, value '0' (not dropped out) or '1' (dropped
    out). For s subject that has dropped out, FACTS will apply the
    defined value for the subject from the 'Last Visit#'.

-   Baseline, this should be the subjects baseline score -- if it has
    been defined (on the Study tab) that baseline is being analyzed,
    otherwise it is ignored.

-   Visit1-... these are the subjects response values at the defined
    visits (on the Study tab), up to and including the final visit.

If data is entered and then 'Run Analysis' clicked, the data is saved to
a file called 'patients.dat' and the analysis results saved to a folder
called 'Analysis' within the "_results" folder of the design.

![](./coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image83.png){}

The 'Save As' button can be used to save the file with a different name,
but it will still be saved within the _Results folder.

A specific results folder is also created, called 'Analysis_\<file
name\>'.

## Loading Data From a File

As well as entering the data via FACTS its possible to load the data
from a 'subject.csv' file. These can be created within FACTS or outside
of FACTS and once created can be edited FACTS or outside of FACTS.

We have tried to make it particularly easy to enter, modify and analyze
data in N-CRM because this is a useful way to explore the properties of
the design in addition to simulation.

### The subject.csv file format

The file is a simple ascii file with the different data items separated
by commas. Any line starting with '#'' is ignored, here we use that to
include a header row. The data may also include spaces to aid
readability (but **not**, currently, tabs). Each line defines the dose
given to a single subject and that subject's response.

The format of the file is the same as the 'patientsNNNN.csv' output
file, (Section 18.5 below) and the column values described above.

### Converting arrival date value from days to weeks

From FACTS 7.0 the value in the Date field is interpreted as being in
weeks (rather than days as in previous versions). If you have existing
data, a simple conversion tool is provided "Convert Date from Days to
Weeks" that simply divides all the Date values by 7. Having run it, you
then need to save the modified data. The values of the Date field will
only make a difference to TTE analyses.

## Data file management on the Analysis tab

From FACTS 6.2 onwards FACTS now supports multiple subject data files
and analysis folders.

Buttons that allow the subject data file to be changed:

-   'Select File to Create New Analysis: launches a file browser that
    allows the user to select a new ".csv" file from any location. The
    selected file is copied to the "\_Results" folder (retaining its
    current name) and made the current subject data file.

-   'Rename Current Analysis' allows the name of the current subject
    data file to be changed.

-   'Select Difference Analysis' allows a different subject data file
    that is in the "\_Results" folder to be made the current subject
    data file.

-   'Delete Analysis' allows any of the subject data files that are in
    the "\_Results" folder to be deleted.

The name of the current subject data file and the name of the
corresponding analysis folder are shown below the subject data file
buttons.

There are five buttons that allow the currently loaded subject data file
to be modified:

-   'Delete Row' deletes the currently selected row in the data grid.
    The data in the current subject file is not updated unless the
    current data is saved.

-   'Delete All' clears all the data in the data grid. The data in the
    current subject file is not updated unless the current data is
    saved.

-   'Reload data' replaces the data in the data grid with the data that
    is still in the current subject data file.

-   'Save As' saves the current data in the data grid to a new subject
    data file in the "\_Results" folder, and makes that the current
    subject data file.

-   "Save" saves the current data in the data grid to the current
    subject data file.

Running an analysis performs a 'Save' before running the analysis.

## Running an Analysis

Once data has been loaded or entered, the user can click the 'Run
Analysis' button.

Once the analysis has run, FACTS displays the recommendation, and a
graph showing the data.

## Analysis Options

At the top of the analysis tab there are various parameters that can be
set to control the analysis performed:

![](./coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image87.png){width="6.925in"
height="2.03125in"}

-   The MCMC parameters

    -   "Burn-in" for the number of initial samples that are discarded

    -   "Length" for the number of samples drawn to form the posterior
        distributions

    -   Random number seed that can be set to generate a different
        sampling sequence

    -   Whether an MCMC file is to be output (which enables the ability
        to view sample history graphs for the model parameters).

    -   Edit command line parameters allows expert users to enter
        command line parameters to be passed to the design engine that
        are not settable through this panel.

    -   The user specifies which interim the analysis is for and hence
        which decision criteria to be applied

        -   The user supplied the interim analysis number or

        -   Selects "Do Final Analysis" which causes the analysis to use
            the final evaluation success/futility criteria.

    -   The user specifies the current week of the trial if the amount
        if information defined by "opportunity to complete" is required.

    -   If this is an arm dropping design, it is possible to flag which,
        if any, doses have already been dropped and hence to be excluded
        from future adaptation decisions, but included in the analysis
        \[this can be used even if the design is not an arm dropping
        design -- to allow for an arm being dropped for reasons outside
        the scope of the simulation, such as logistical or safety
        reasons but only be entering the '-armsdropped' command line
        parameter the control is only displayed if the design includes
        arm dropping\].
