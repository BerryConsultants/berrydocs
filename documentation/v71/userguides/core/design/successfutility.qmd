The Success/Futility Criteria tab is where users specify the decision rules
for determining study success or failure. The Final Analysis criteria always
exist, and should, in general, be specified for every simulated trial. If
simulating an adaptive trial, then interim analysis decision rules are also
specified here.

# Decisions in FACTS Core

There are $7$ possible decisions that can be made in a FACTS Core design, each
with a numeric identifier that FACTS uses in the .csv output to denote
decisions:

1. Early Success
: Early success is achieved if and only if the trial meets the success condition
at an interim analysis, and does not meet the futility criteria at the final analysis.
The final analysis criteria must not be met whether or not subjects were selected
to follow-up after an early success decision.

2. Late Success
: Late success is achieved if and only if the trial enrolls to the maximum sample
size, collects full follow-up, and then meets the final analysis success criteria.

3. Late Futility
: Late success is achieved if and only if the trial enrolls to the maximum sample
size, collects full follow-up, and then meets the final analysis futility criteria.
Late futility is not automatically the complement of late success; the futility
rule must be specified as the complement of the success rule to make it true.

4. Early Futility
: Early futility is achieved if and only if the trial meets the futility condition
at an interim analysis, and does not meet the success criteria at the final analysis.
The final analysis criteria must not be met whether or not subjects were selected
to follow-up after an early success decision.

5. Success to futility flip-flop
: Success to futility flip-flop is achieved if and only if the trial meets the
success condition at an interim analysis, but meets the futility condition at the
final analysis. Success to futility flip-flops can be achieved whether or not
subjects are followed up after the early success decision.

6. Futility to success flip-flop
: Futility to success flip-flop is achieved if and only if the trial meets the
futility condition at an interim analysis, but meets the success condition at the
final analysis. Futility to success flip-flops can be achieved whether or not
subjects are followed up after the early futility decision.

7. Inconclusive
: Inconclusive is achieved if and only if the trial enrolls to the maximum sample
size, collects full follow-up, and then does not meet the final success or
final futility criteria.

Every simulated trial will result in exactly one of these decisions. Non-adaptive
trials will result in either Late Success, Late Futility, or Inconclusive. An
adaptive trial that does not stop at an interim analysis will result in Late
Success, Late Futility, or Inconclusive. An adaptive trial that stops enrolling for early
success at an interim analysis will end up as an Early Success or a Success to
Futility flip-flop. An adaptive trial that stops enrolling for early futility will result
in Early Futility or Futility to Success flip-flop.

# Final Evaluation

On the Final Evaluation tab, the user can specify rules for
judging the study for final futility or final success at its end.

The left column of the Final Evaluation tab contains the specification of the
trial final futility rule, and the right column contains the specification of
the final success rule.

To add a decision rule, click the "Add..." button within the appropriate column,
select a decision quantity QOI, a comparison inequality sign, and a threshold.
Final success and final futility criteria can each have multiple components to them,
and the selection at the bottom of the column called "Combine criteria using:"
dictates if success or futility should be declared if every single criteria is met
(AND) or if any criteria is met (OR).

The success and futility rules need not be complementary - there can be trials
that do not meet either criteria at the final analysis. These trials would be
considered inconclusive. It is allowable, although generally not recommended, to specify overlapping success and futility
rules. If a trial were to satisfy both the success and futility criteria at the
final analysis it would be considered a final futility.

The Final Evaluation Criteria are always applied at the time of the
final analysis, even if the study stops early for success or futility,
and whether or not “Continue follow-up if study stopped for success” or
“Continue follow-up if study stopped for futility” are selected. As a
result, setting final analysis criteria that are easier to satisfy than
interim analysis criteria may result in the labelling of trials that
meet the interim analysis criteria but do not satisfy the final analysis
criteria as flip-flops.

# Interim Analysis Criteria

On the success/futility criteria of a design with "Enable adaptive features"
checked on the Study > Study Info page, the user can specify rules for
judging the study for futility or success at an interim and at the final
evaluation. If the trial has no interims there will be just a tab for
the Final Evaluation criteria. If the trial has interim analyses, then
there can be tabs that define different early success/futility criteria
at the different interims.

At the top of the main tab is a control to allow tabs to be created for
different interims. In a newly created adaptive design, FACTS will
create a tab for interim 1.

If early success/futility criteria are specified for an interim, then
they will be taken to apply to all subsequent interims until the next
one for which criteria are supplied, then those criteria will apply
until the next interim for which criteria are applied and so on. There will
be no stopping for success or futility until the first interim for which
early stopping criteria have been defined.

It is possible to specify overlapping early success and early futility criteria at
an interim, but it is not possible to stop
for both success and futility at the same time. The FACTS design
engines will stop the trial but the user should not rely on one or
other outcome taking precedence. It is not considered good practice
to have success and futility rules that could both be true, so FACTS
does not [guarantee a “tie break” rule](## "As of FACTS 7.1 early futility will
be the result if both early success and early futility criteria are met.").

In the output files there are columns labeled “Success <QOI>”
and “Futile <QOI>” indicating whether any decision criteria
became true, and “Success Combined” and “Futile Combined” indicating
if all the criteria for a success or futility determination have
been met. If both sets of criteria are met simultaneously, FACTS
will only flag one of “Success Combined” and “Futile Combined” as
being met, corresponding to how the outcome of the trial has been
flagged.

Having created a tab to define the early success/futility criteria at an
interim, the user has options to delete the tab or to copy criteria that
have already been entered on another tab before editing them.

The user specifies:

-   Whether early stopping for futility or success is to be allowed by
    selecting the “Futility criteria” or “Success criteria”

-   The stopping rules are specified, by selecting the QOI to be tested,
    the direction of the comparison and the threshold value for the
    criteria to be met, as in the Final Evaluation tab above.

-   The user can specify whether, if multiple criteria have been
    specified, they all need to be meet (Criteria combined using “AND”)
    or only any one of them needs to be met (Criteria combined using
    “OR”). These are specified independently for stopping for success
    and for futility.

-   If stopping is allowed, the user specifies what the minimum amount
    of information (using the information type specified on the Interims
    tab). This can be specified both in overall terms and information on
    specific doses. If multiple minimum-information criteria are
    specified they must all be met for the QOI criteria to be evaluated.
