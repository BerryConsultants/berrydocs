#  Interims

Interim analyses allow for decision making throughout the lifecycle of
an adaptive trial in FACTS. Interim analyses can adjust allocation
probabilities, drop arms, or allow for early success/futility of the
trial. Interims can either be specified with calendar frequency –
occurring every specified number of weeks or specified to occur after a
specified amount of information has been collected.

## Interim Analysis Triggers

### Continuous and Dichotomous Endpoint

Information can be defined in terms of:

-   number of subjects that have been recruited

-   the number of subjects who have actually completed a specified visit

-   the number of subjects who have had the opportunity to complete a
    specified visit (includes drop-outs)

When specifying an interim analysis schedule, it can be done either based
on time or based on one of the information categories above.

If specifying interims based on time the first interim
analysis timing must be based on information,
and each subsequent interim is triggered after the provided amount of time
has elapsed. If accrual completes before the first interim threshold is reached,
and the first interim was defined in terms of the number of subjects
enrolled, then the interims by time start at full accrual. If the first
interim is defined in any other terms (by events, subjects complete or
subjects with opportunity to complete) then interims only start when
this is reached (which might be never).

If specifying interims based solely on information, the table
on the "Interims" tab determines when the analyses will be triggered.
Each interim is defined individually by the number of
patients/observations that have satisfied some criteria. If information is
If information is defined as Subjects Enrolled, then interim are triggered
immediately upon enrollment of the subject satisfying the criteria. If
information is defined as completers or opportunity to complete, then interims
are triggered immediately upon the visit being reached that satisfies the
specified criteria. Successive interims must be in terms of the same or
more observations at the same or later visit, and either Visit or Subject must
increase. Different types of information cannot be mixed to trigger interim analyses
except in using time to trigger interims after the first based on information.

If interims are governed by time, there is the
option as to whether interims should continue after full accrual, or
discontinue.

### Time-to-Event Endpoint

Information can be defined in terms of:

-   number of subjects that have been recruited

-   the number of subjects who have observed their predictor endpoint

-   the number of subjects who have had the opportunity to observe their
    predictor endpoint (includes drop-outs)

-   specified numbers of events observed

-   specified number of predictor events observed

Outside of the new types of information, the time-to-event triggers work
in exactly the same way that continuous and dichotomous triggers do.

## Subject Follow-up Options

Regardless of endpoint, the Interims tab contains options that control
the behaviour should a trial stop at an interim analysis. The options allows the
user to specify whether or not to complete the follow-up of subjects who
have been accrued, but have not had time to observe their final
endpoint.

The default options available for Subject Follow-Up are:

-   Continue follow-up if study stopped for early success

-   Continue follow-up if study stopped for early futility

If the check box corresponding to an interim decision is checked, then
at the time of an interim analysis decision - accrual will be stopped, all
subjects currently enrolled will be followed-up until they have had the
opportunity to observe their final endpoint, and then the final analysis
will be performed.

If the check box corresponding to an interim decision is not checked,
then at the time of an interim analysis decision - accrual is stopped, the
data is locked, and no follow-up on randomized patients is collected.
The interim dataset is the final dataset. [The final analysis is then
performed using the same data and model as was used for the interim
analysis.](## "This can result in success to futility flip-flops or futility
to success flip-flops, even if there is no additional follow-up, since the
final analysis criteria can be specified to be less strict than the interim
analysis threshold. If you do not follow up after a success, then a success
to futility flip-flop can be considered simply an early success.")

If the allocation method is selected as, “Arm Dropping,” then an
additional check box is provided in the Subject Follow-up Options box
asking whether the user would like to “Continue follow-up if arm
dropped.” If the box is checked, then subjects randomized to an arm that
is dropped before they have the opportunity to complete their follow-up
will have to opportunity to observe their final endpoint for subsequent
analyses. If the box is not checked then incomplete subjects on an arm
that is dropped will never have future endpoint values observed.
