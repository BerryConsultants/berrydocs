On the Frequentist Analysis tab the user can specify that some standard
frequentist analyses be performed at trial analyses. The
frequentist analysis tab is completely separate from, and independent of,
any p-value QOIs that have been defined. The analyses specified on this tab cannot be used for simulated trial decisions - they are for storing in output only.

Each specified analysis can be conducted using a variety of ways of handling missingness. Select all ways of handling missingness that are desired:

-   Missing data replaced by last observation carried forward (LOCF)

-   Missing data replaced by baseline observation carried forward
    (BOCF). This is only available if the endpoint is continuous and
    Baseline is being simulated.

-   Missing data is ignored (a “per-protocol” analysis).

-   Missing data is treated as a failure. This is only available if the
    endpoint is dichotomous.

If the trial has interim analyses, then for the simulations for which
frequentist weeks files are to be output (specified on the Simulation
tab) the standard frequentist analyses will be performed. If the trial
has p-values QOIs, those QOIs are calculated every interim in all
simulations.

Having the frequentist analysis include [Dunnett's](#dunnett "Dunnett CW. A multiple comparison procedure for comparing several treatments with a control. Journal of the American Statistical Association. 1955; 50: 1096-1121.") adjusted p-values is a separate option (that applies to all the analysis type requested)
because of the significant run-time overhead this can entail. [Dunnett's](#dunnett "Dunnett CW. A multiple comparison procedure for comparing several treatments with a control. Journal of the American Statistical Association. 1955; 50: 1096-1121.")
adjustment is available for continuous and dichotomous frequentist
analyses.

The frequentist analysis tabs for the continuous and dichotomous engines
also have trend tests, and allow the user to specify contrast
coefficients to conduct those tests.

Note that the reported frequentist estimates of the treatment effect
take the specified direction of response on the Study tab (whether a
response indicates subject improving or worsening) into account. They
are adjusted so that a treatment that is estimated to be better than the
control always has a positive treatment effect.

# Continuous Endpoints

At the end of each simulated trial the following frequentist values will
be calculated for each missingness handling method checked:

1.  Using unadjusted dose-placebo comparisons based on a two-sample
    t-test calculate the:

    1.  test statistic,

    2.  (p-value)[## "1-sided p-value is reported in all the frequentist results. This is done in order to be consistent with comparisons with 1-sided α-values elsewhere."],

    3.  confidence interval for the mean difference,

    4.  for each dose its marginal probabilities of significance (the
        number of times it was significantly separated from placebo
        independent of whether any other doses were) .

2.  If selected, using [Dunnett](#dunnett "Dunnett CW. A multiple comparison procedure for comparing several treatments with a control. Journal of the American Statistical Association. 1955; 50: 1096-1121.")-adjusted dose-placebo comparisons based on a two-sample t-test calculate the:

    1.  test statistic,

    2.  p-value,

    3.  confidence interval for the mean difference

    4.  for each dose its marginal probabilities of significance (the
        number of times it was significantly separated from placebo
        independent of whether any other doses were) .

3.  Using the general trend test calculate the t-test statistic and
    p-value using user supplied contrast coefficients.

If neither placebo nor an active comparator are simulated, a difference from
0 is assessed for each dose arm and [Dunnett](#dunnett "Dunnett CW. A multiple comparison procedure for comparing several treatments with a control. Journal of the American Statistical Association. 1955; 50: 1096-1121.")-adjusted calculations are not carried out.

If high values of the endpoint are good, P-values are calculated using a one-sided t-test testing
$$H_0: \mu_T < \mu_C$$
against
$$H_1: \mu_T \ge \mu_C$$
with $\mu_T$ being the true treatment response mean and $\mu_C$ being the true control response mean. If low values of the endpoint are good, then the signs of the hypotheses are flipped.

# Dichotomous Endpoints

At the end of each simulated trial the following frequentist values will
be calculated for each missingness handling method checked:

1.  Using the methodology described by [Agresti](#agresti "Agresti, A. 2002.  Categorical Data Analysis. Second Edition. Wiley."), [Mee](#mee "Mee, R. W. 1984. Confidence bounds for the difference between two probabilities. Biometrics. 40, 1175-1176.") and [Nurminem](#nurminem "Nurminen, M. 1986. Confidence intervals for the ratio and difference of two binomial proportions. Biometrics. 42, 675-676.") for comparing the difference of proportions:

    1.  test statistic,

    2.  p-value,

    3.  95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions,

    4.  marginal probabilities of significance.

2.  If checked, using [Dunnett](#dunnett "Dunnett CW. A multiple comparison procedure for comparing several treatments with a control. Journal of the American Statistical Association. 1955; 50: 1096-1121.")-adjusted dose-placebo comparisons for comparing the
    difference of proportions:

    1.  test statistic,

    2.  p-value,

    3.  95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions,

    4.  marginal probabilities of significance.

3.  Using the general trend test calculate the t-test statistic and
    p-value using user supplied contrast coefficients.

P-values are calculated by user choice either using a normal
approximation (see previous section on p-value calculations for
continuous endpoints) or a Fisher’s exact test, which is a conservative
test to test the null hypothesis that the outcome is independent of the
treatment assignment. For the normality approximation to have good
asymptotic coverage, the expected number of successes and failures under
the null hypothesis should be greater or equal to 5 for both groups. In
cases where this is not guaranteed, Fisher’s exact test is recommended
when strict type 1 error control is required.

If neither placebo nor active comparator are specified, a difference from 0
is assessed for each dose arm and [Dunnett](#dunnett "Dunnett CW. A multiple comparison procedure for comparing several treatments with a control. Journal of the American Statistical Association. 1955; 50: 1096-1121.")-adjusted calculations are not carried out.

# Time-to-Event Frequentist Analysis

For each simulated trial, the following frequentist analyses will be
performed:

1.  Dose-placebo comparisons based on log-rank test and the Cox
    proportional hazards model. Summaries include:

    1.  The log-rank and Wilcoxon test statistics and the corresponding
        p-values,

    2.  Estimated hazard ratio and its confidence interval from Cox
        model,

    3.  For each dose its marginal probabilities of significance (the
        number of times it was significantly separated from placebo
        independent of whether any other doses were, based on the hazard
        ratio inference from the Cox model).

2.  Median survival times based on the Kaplan-Meier method.

3.  For the predictor, descriptive statistics are computes – a 7 number
    summary for a continuous predictor, percentages for the dichotomous
    predictor, and median time, average hazard, and a cox model with
    predictor as covariate are computed for a time to event predictor.

The following variations for adjusting the alpha level for multiple
comparisons should be available using the user-specified 1-sided alpha:
unadjusted, and Bonferonni adjusted.
