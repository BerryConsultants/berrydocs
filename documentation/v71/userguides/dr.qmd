#  Introduction

## Purpose and Scope of this document

This document describes usage and how to update the installation of the Design Report Generator, an automated report generation tool, included with FACTS. It is intended for anyone concerned with using the automated report generation facility. The Report Generator is available only for the desktop version of FACTS.

# Using the Design Report Generator from FACTS

## Software prerequisites

In order to run the report generator directly from FACTS, you will need the following installed on your Windows machine on which you are using FACTS:

- A reasonably recent version of R (v3.5.3+) along with the R libraries ‘rmarkdown’, ‘xtable’ and ‘stringi’ installed.
- RStudio (the Design Report Generator uses two packages that come with RStudio – “mathjax” and “pandoc”, these can now be obtained separately but given the ubiquity of RStudio FACTS simply requires you to have that installed).
- Recently we’ve experienced some problems with “pandoc”, downloading and installing from the pandoc website (https://pandoc.org), then re-starting Windows has fixed them.
- Microsoft Word or Open Office
- FACTS v7.0 or later

## Setup

You will need to inform FACTS of the location of R, or RStudio on your computer.

To do this start FACTS and go to menu option: “Settings \> Options” and then to the “R Configuration” tab.

Select the R/RStudio version you would like to use.

If the version you wish to use isn’t shown, use the “Add” button to open a file browser to navigate to the version of R that you wish to use and select the appropriate version of “R.exe”.

If you need to add RStudio, after clicking on “Add”, you will need to change the file filter (lower right corner) of the file browser window from “R.exe” to “RStudio.exe”, navigate to RStudio\bin directory and select “RStudio.exe”.

## Steps for generating a design report

To generate a design report from FACTS, you will need to do the
following sequence of steps:

1.  Simulate your design in FACTS.
2.  (In case you have previously generated a report for your design
    using the report generator, you will need to make sure that the
    previous version of the report is not open in Word when you generate a new report.)
3.  After selecting the R version, go to the “Simulation” tab and click on the “Design Report...” button. If you have selected plain R
    (i.e., not RStudio) then a Word document with the report should pop up. It will give you a warning before building the Table of
    Contents. Click “Yes” and your report should appear.
4.  If you selected RStudio, you should see RStudio open up as shown
    below. Copy the highlighted command and paste it into the R-prompt  and your Word report will be generated which you will need to open yourself. (Again, it will give you a warning before building the Table of Contents. Click “Yes”.)

## Usage Notes

### Location of the generated Word file

The generated report document is stored in the “results” folder of your FACTS simulation (e.g., if your FACTS project is saved as
*CoreDesign.facts*, the folder named *CoreDesign_results* is the
corresponding ‘results’ folder).

### Suggested steps after generating the report

A typical workflow after initially generating the report is as follows:

1.  Review the generated report for correctness, and fix minor
    typographical and formatting errors if any.
2.  If you would like to use a predefined Word template, you could apply the template to your report.
3.  Modify the default table style and add table cross-references as
    needed.
4.  Add additional text and figures as needed.

### Location of the Report Generator source files

The Design Report Generator uses R and Rmarkdown to create the report document. The script files used by the Report Generator are stored in the “ReportGenerator” folder under your FACTS installation folder. (It might be named something like `C:\Program Files (x86)\BerryConsultants\FACTS 7.0.0\ReportGenerator`).
The files within this folder with file extensions of “.R”, “.Rnw” and “.docx” are the ones required by the Report Generator. If an updated version of the Report Generator is made available either as a bug-fix or intermediate release, it will consist of updated “.R”, “.Rnw” and “.docx” files. Simply replacing the corresponding files in the original installation folder will deploy the updated version.
