FACTS Platform Trials is useful for simulating trials in which there are a number
of treatments being tested against a common control arm. Unlike in the FACTS
Core engine, each of these treatments is meant to stand alone, and decisions
are made on individual arms rather than at the trial level. As a result, there
is not expected to be a dose-response relationship between the treatments. Two
common goals of platform trials are to find many effective treatments among a
set of treatments or to find a single effective treatment arm as quickly as
possible. Treatments in a platform trial can leave the trial when a decision has been
made for that arm or they have reached their sample size cap, and new treatment
arms can enter when they are available to begin randomizing.

FACTS V7.0 was the first version of FACTS to feature a Platform Trial
simulator.

This first version of the Platform Trial simulator FACTS provides fairly
limited options for the statistical analysis:

-   The endpoint can be Continuous or Dichotomous.

-   Treatments are compared to a common control arm - either all randomized
    controls or concurrent controls only.

-   Trial Updates (a.k.a. interim analyses) can be specified in a number of ways:
    fixed intervals by time, the number of subjects recruited, the number
    of subjects complete up to a specified visit or the number of subjects
    who have had the opportunity to complete up to a specified visit.

-   Milestones are defined that apply to each treatment arm separately
    and different decision rules or thresholds can be defined based on which
    milestones have been reached by the arm.

-   Updates can be organized in one of three ways:

    -   Updates occur whenever an arm meets a milestone, and that arm's
        appropriate milestone rules are checked.

    -   Updates occur on a regular basis, and at each update each arm is
        checked to see if it has passed a new milestone, and if it has,
        the appropriate milestone rules are checked.

    -   Updates occur on a regular basis, and the milestone rules are checked
        for the highest milestone that has been
        passed. This allows that a particular milestone's rules are
        checked repeatedly if updates are frequent.

# The FACTS Platform Trail Design GUI

The FACTS Platform Trial GUI conforms to the standard FACTS GUI layout,
with information and displays divided across various standard tabs
(@fig-tabset).

![The tabs available in the Platform Trials engine.](./platformattachments/media/image4.png){#fig-tabset}

Trial
: The Trial Tabs are for entering the main characteristics of the
study and specifying the treatment arms to be tested in the study.
This is where the user specifies the 'given' requirements, or
constraints, of the trial to be designed.

Virtual Response
: The Virtual Response tabs are for specifying the simulation of
subject responses, specifying the mean response for each treatment
arm and the dropout rates.

Accrual
: The Accrual tab is for specifying the rate of subject accrual.

Quantities of Interest
: The Quantities of Interest tabs are for specifying the quantities to
be calculated during analyses for output in the results, and
possible use in adaptive allocation, early stopping and final
evaluation decisions.

Design
: The Design tabs are for specifying the statistical analysis to be
used. These are the design choices open to the trial biostatistician
and can include how to model the final responses, what decisions to
take at trial updates and how to make decisions for individual
treatment arms. The expected consequences of these design choices
are then estimated by running simulations of the trials using the
various virtuaresponse profiles defined.

Simulation
: On the Simulation tab, the user controls and runs simulations and
can view the simulation results.

Also on the menu bar, on the right hand side of the FACTS Window, is a
button labeled "Notes"; clicking this button reveals a simple "notepad"
window in which the user can maintain some simple notes that will be
stored within the ".facts" file.

:::{layout="[[1,3]]"}

![The notes button.](./platformattachments/media/image5.png){#fig-notesbutton}

![Example of a note.](./platformattachments/media/image6.png){#fig-noteexample}

:::

The notepad window comes with two further buttons: one to change the
window to a free floating one that can be moved away from the FACTCS
window; and the other to close it.

The Notes field can be used for any text the user wishes to store with
the file. Suggested uses are: to record the changes made in a particular
version of a design and why; and to comment on the simulation results.
This will help when coming back to work that has been set aside, to
recall what gave rise to the different version of a design.

# The Trial tab

![The trial info tab for a continuous endpoint.](./platformattachments/media/image3.png){#fig-trialinfo}

## Trial Info

The Trial Info sub-tab provides parameters for specifying characteristics of
the platform trial, including whether the design is adaptive, the sample
size, the number of arms allowed to enroll simultaneously, and the time
to observe the endpoint.

### Design Options:

#### Enable adaptive features

Specify whether the design is adaptive. If
adaptive features are not enabled, some adaptive-specific
parameters and tabs are hidden, such as the tabs for defining
trial updates, early stopping criteria, and adaptive
allocation options on the allocation tab.

#### Use longitudinal modeling

Currently, longitudinal modelling is not implemented for the platform
trials engine.

#### Endpoint Specific Inputs

:::{.panel-tabset}

#### Continuous

##### Include simulation of baseline

Whether to simulate participant's baseline score or simply
change from baseline. If simulating baseline, whether the
analysis is based on change from baseline or final endpoint value.

#### Dichotomous

##### Enable special longitudinal options

Special longitudinal options are not enabled currently in FACTS platform trials.

:::

### Trial Information

The platform trial will automatically terminate when all of the defined treatments have had a chance to enter the trial and complete their enrollment and follow-up. Arms that attempt to join the platform, but are not allowed to, are considered complete.

#### Max enrollment time (wks)

You may limit the total enrollment time of the platform as a whole. If the trial reaches this time limit it stops and a final analysis is performed.

#### Max number of participants

You may limit the total number of subjects that can be enrolled to the platform. If the trial reaches this number of subjects it stops accruing, follows up subjects, and performs a final analysis.

#### Max successful treatments

You may stop the platform when a specified number of successful treatments have been found. This is useful for platfroms only interested in finding a specific number of successful treatments.

#### Max participants per treatment

Each arm is only allowed a specified maximum number of subjects to be enrolled to them. When an arm reaches this cap, it stopps accruing new subjects, but continues collecting follow-up on those that have been accrued. At full follow-up the arm specific final analysis is performed.

#### Max concurrent treatments

This option allows you to specify the maximum number of non-control treatments that can be enrolling during the platform. If there are fewer than this number of active arms enrolling, then new arms are allowed to enter the platform. If there are already arms randomizing equal to the value provided here, then no new treatment arms are allowed to join the platform. Treatment arms that are ready to begin enrolling, but are not allowed to start, begin a waiting period.

#### Response

Specify whether a higher response indicates the subject improving or worsening (and thus whether a higher or lower mean response is a good thing).

### Schedule of Post Baseline Visits

Enter the time, in weeks, it takes to observe the final response for a subject after enrollment. No visit schedule is currently available, since longitudinal modeling has not been included in FACTS Platform Trials.

## Trial Arms

### Definition

This sub-tab is used to specify the set of arms that will be considered
for participation throughout the course of the platform trial. Not all of these arms must accrue subject in each simulated trial, and which arms do accrue subjects depends on the state of each individual trial.

![The Trial > Trial Arms > Definition tab.](./platformattachments/media/image14.png){#fig-armdefinition}

In the current implementation, a control arm is required.

Clicking the "Add" button creates a new active arm. Selecting a row, and clicking "Delete Arm" will remove the selected active arm. Clicking "Clear all arms" will delete all active arms from the table. The arms names can be changed in the table.

Arms are considered independent in the platform trial engine, so Index (d) ordering is irrelevant.

The number of arms defined here determines the maximum number of treatments that can enter the simulated trials. If the simulation does not stop through meeting one of the optional maximums that can be specified on the Trial \> Trial Info tab, then it will stop when the last treatment from this list to complete enrollment completes the follow-up of the last patient allocated to
it.

### Arrivals

The arrivals sub-tab is used to specify the timing for treatment arms
becoming available in the trial simulation. In the current
implementation, the control arm is always available starting at time 0. Multiple arrival
schedules may be set up by adding multiple profiles.

![The Trial > Trial Arms > Arrivals tab.](./platformattachments/media/image15.png){#fig-armarrivals}

For each arm defined on the Trial Arm > Definition tab, the Arrivals tab requires 3 inputs.

#### Earliest/Latest Possible Arrival (wks)

These column specify the range
of times (in weeks) that an arm becomes available to enter the
trial. For a given simulation, the actual arrival time is simulated
uniformly between the earliest and latest possible times. To simulate a trial
with an arm that always enters at the exact same time provide the same value for the earliest and latest possible arrivals for the arm.

Once an arm has reached its time of arrival, it is allowed to enter the trial if:

- There are less than 'max concurrent treatments' currently enrolling in the trial, and

- The trial is performing:

    -   updates at milestones,

    -   updates on a regular schedule and it is executing an update,

    -   updates on a regular schedule and arms can enter between
        updates.

#### Withdrawn If Not Used Within

This column specifies how long an
arm will wait to begin enrolling in the trial before it "gives up" and withdraws
from the trial. That is, if the arm becomes available while there
are already more active treatment arms than the max concurrent
treatments (as specified on the Trial \> Trial Info tab), then the
arm must wait before being allowed to enter the trial. In that case,
if no arm leaves the trial before the end of the waiting period, the
waiting arm will withdraw and never enter the trial.

In the case of a tie in arrival times, the lower-indexed arm is entered
into the trial first.

To create a trial in which arms never "time out" and withdraw from the study, enter a very large value in the Withdrawn if not used within column.

## Variants

On this tab the user can specify that a number of design variants should
be created. Currently the only two design features that can be changed
are

-   the maximum sample size per treatment.

-   The maximum number of concurrent treatments at any time.

If "multiple variants" is checked then the user can specify that
simulations setups should be created for each simulation scenario with
versions of the design with a different maximum number of subjects.

The user enters the number of variants they wish to create. Then in the
resulting table, enter different "Maximum Participants per Treatment"
and "Max Concurrent Treatments" for each variant. On the simulations tab
FACTS will then create a copy of all the scenarios to run with each
variant.

![The Variants tab for platform trials.](./platformattachments/media/image16.png){#fig-ptvariants}

In the above screenshot, 6 variants have been created testing 3 x 2
combinations of Max participants per treatment of 80, 90 and 100 and Max
concurrent treatments of 3 and 4. These will override the values for
these parameters that have been specified on the Trial Info tab. It
there are for example 2 response profiles to simulate, this will give 6
x 2 scenarios to simulate:

![The simulation tab showing 6 different variants creating extra scenarios.](./platformattachments/media/image17.png){#fig-ptvariantssimtab}

# Virtual Subject Response

As with all FACTS design engines the Virtual Subject Response tab allows
the user to explicitly define virtual subject response profiles, and/or
to import virtual externally simulated patient responses from an exteral file. When simulations are executed, they will be executed for a
specific scenario -- where a scenario is a combination of one of each
type of profile -- dose response, longitudinal (not yet implemented),
accrual, and dropout.

The VSR tab in the platform trials engine differs from the VSR tab in the Core engines in a few ways. The biggest changes are the treatment classification method and that treatment efficacies can be simulated from distributions in the platform trials engine.

## Treatment Classification

Many outputs and graphs depend on a classification of the treatment
effect as "good," "mediocre," or "unacceptable." The thresholds provided on this tab are used in this classification.
These treatment effect thresholds are applied to the true effect size
for the simulation. For fixed effects, a treatment arm will be
categorized the same in all simulations, but if sampled from a
distribution, its categorization may vary from simulation to simulation.
This categorization is used for some operating characteristic output
such as "The number of good arms that were successful" and plots.

![The Virtual Response > Treatment Classification tab.](./platformattachments/media/image18.png){#fig-trtclassification}

An example of how this can be important is considering a quantity like power: the probability of success given the treatment has some assumed level of effect. When the treatment effect is assumed to have some fixed value this calculation is easy. When the treatment effect is drawn from a distribution, sometimes the effect is strong, but sometimes it's weak or even null/negative. Creating a classification system allows for the replacement of a traditional "power" with the probability of success given that the arm's efficacy falls into the "good" class.

It's still typical to consider an arm's Type I error to be the probability of success given the arm has a fixed efficacy exactly equal to the control arm.

## Response Specification -- Continuous Endpoint

With a conventional continuous response being simulated, FACTS allows
subject responses to be simulated by specifying the mean response
(change from baseline) and the standard deviation (SD) of the response.

### Arm Response -- Continuous Endpoint

This sub-tab allows the user to set up several scenarios for how the
true response to be simulated for each treatment arm. Two types of
inputs are needed for a given scenario:

1.  The mean response for each treatment arm. There are three ways that
    the mean response can be specified.

    a.  Fixed mean *response*. This specifies the actual mean value for
        the arm in the Value column. This option is somewhat redundant
        with the fixed mean effect option, except in the case when the
        control arm is sampled from a distribution.

    b.  Fixed mean *effect*. This specifies the difference between the
        treatment arm and the control arm in the Value column. Note:
        FACTS does *not* use the convention that positive effects always
        indicate improvement. I.e., if "Lower response is improvement"
        is specified on the Trial \> Trial Info tab, an effective arm
        should have a negative effect value.\
        This option is not available for the control arm.

    c.  A distribution. Rather than specifying a specific value for the
        mean value, a distribution of values can be chosen. Each
        simulated trial will then have a (possibly) different value for
        the mean response for the arm. Distributions will be available
        for selection in the drop-down menu for the treatment arms, with
        one option for each distribution profile set up on the Virtual
        Response \> Explicitly Defined \> Treatment Distribution
        sub-tab. If a distribution is chosen, the value in the Value
        column is ignored.\
        If this selection is made for the control arm, the selection is
        called "Sampled", and the distribution is specified on this tab,
        in the "Control Sampled Mean Response" box.

> If baseline is not being modeled, this simulated response is 'change
> from baseline'. If baseline is being simulated the user can select
> whether the response to be analyzed is the change from baseline or
> absolute response (the option is selected on the Study tab), depending
> on that selection the response specified on this tab is either change
> from baseline or absolute response. \[**Note**: the mean response to
> be analyzed is always as specified on this tab, if the analysis is on
> change from baseline then the response specified here is change from
> baseline, if the response to be analyzed is absolute, then the
> response specified here is the absolute final score.\].

2.  The standard deviation of the response -- either through a common SD
    of response for all treatment arms, or by specifying the standard
    deviation for the response on each treatment arm separately. \[Note
    that the total variance in the observed final responses can be
    greater than this if a baseline adjustment for subject response is
    specified\]

height="4.439343832020997in"}

### Treatment Distribution -- Continuous Endpoint

This tab is used to set up distribution profiles, so that the arm
response is drawn randomly for each simulated trial. Any distribution
profile that is added on this sub-tab will appear as an option in the
drop-down menu for the Mean Fixed/Sampled column in the Arm Response
sub-tab. For each distribution profile, three components must be
established by the user:

1.  Response vs Effect Size. This selection determines whether the value
    being simulated is the actual mean response or a difference from the
    control arm response. Note: FACTS does not use the convention that
    positive effects always indicate improvement. I.e., if "Lower
    response is improvement" is specified on the Trial \> Trial Info
    tab, an effective arm should have a negative value if Effect Size is
    the selection.

2.  Prob same as control / Prob effect size is 0: The distribution that
    is simulated will be a mixture distribution with a point mass on the
    value of the control arm, and the remaining probability assigned to
    a continuous distribution. This value specifies the probability
    assigned to the point mass. Values of 0 are allowed, meaning that
    only the continuous distribution would be utilized.

3.  The distribution for the continuous portion of the mixture.
    Currently, three distributions types are available.

    a.  The normal distribution, which requires the specification of the
        mean and standard deviation of the distribution.

    b.  The truncated normal distribution, which requires the
        specification of the mean and standard deviation of the
        (non-truncated) distribution, along with the minimum and maximum
        values that are to be allowed. Note: if the maximum (minimum)
        value is left blank in the gui, the value is interpreted as
        infinity (negative infinity), allowing for one-sided truncation.

    c.  The generalized beta distribution, which requires the
        specification of the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard
        deviation. Note that not all combinations of values lead to a
        valid specification of the beta distribution. The mean must be
        between the minimum and maximum, and the standard deviation must
        then be no larger than:\
        $$\sqrt{(Maximum - Mean) \bullet (Mean - Minimum)}$$

> height="4.02in"}

### Baseline -- change from baseline

If simulation of baseline has been included on the Study \> study Info
tab, if response is change from baseline then the explicitly defined
dose response is still in terms of change from baseline, and a new
virtual subject response tab is available for specifying the baseline
score.

![](./platformattachments/media/image21.png){width="6.925in"
height="4.51880905511811in"}

The simulation of distribution of baseline scores is specified using a
normal distribution --with user specified mean and standard deviation
and optionally applied upper and lower bounds to reflect limitations on
the score range or screening criteria. . \[Note that if the observed
baseline score is truncated then the ***true*** mean and SD of the
baseline are likely to be different from these values of the mean and SD
which are before truncation. Even if the upper and lower bounds are
equi-distant above and below the mean the reported true mean may be very
slightly different from the specified mean due to floating point
arithmetic and rounding errors.\]

Either baseline is simulated separately from the final response (for use
with BOCF), or the simulation of the final response can include a
baseline dependent element.

If adjusting the final response based on baseline, then the user selects
"Use Baseline Adjustment for Subject Response" and supplies 3
parameters:

-   Beta - a coefficient that reflects the degree of influence of
    baseline on final score and the degree of variability in the final
    score due to baseline.

-   C -- a centering offset, typically the expected mean of the observed
    baseline scores

-   S -- a scaling element, typically set to the expected SD of the
    baseline.

Example -- in the above screenshot a baseline of mean 25 and SD 10 has
been specified -- so a centering of 25 and scaling of 10 is used.
Wishing to simulate an overall SD of 5 in the final change from baseline
and apportion two-thirds the variance to baseline, Beta has been set as
follows:

-   The desired final variance is 25 (5^2^), divided between 1/3^rd^
    dose response and 2/3^rd^ baseline effects.

-   The SD of the simulated response is set to 2.89
    $\sqrt{\left( 25*\frac{1}{3} \right)}$

-   The SD of the scaled baseline score is 1, so to contribute half the
    final variance of 25, Beta is set to 4.08
    $\sqrt{\left( 25*\frac{2}{3} \right)}$

-   Note that when simulating a baseline effect in this way, limiting
    the range of baseline by specifying upper and lower cut-offs --
    which might be natural limits of the endpoint, or due to inclusion /
    exclusion criteria in the protocol -- can significantly reduce the
    variance in the final endpoint due to the baseline effect.

### Baseline -- final endpoint

If the response is specified to be final endpoint score, then baseline
is specified as above, but the explicitly defined dose response is now
defined in terms of final endpoint.

##  Response Specification -- Dichotomous Endpoint

With a conventional dichotomous response being simulated, FACTS allows
subject responses to be simulated by specifying the rate of the
response.

### Arm Response -- Dichotomous Endpoint

This sub-tab differs for a dichotomous endpoint in that there are
options for how to specify the treatment effect, and no specification of
a standard deviation or baseline value is required. The response rate
must be specified for each arm. There are four ways that the mean
response can be specified.

1.  Fixed response rate. This specifies the actual response rate for the
    arm in the Value column. This option is somewhat redundant with the
    fixed effect option, except in the case when the control arm is
    sampled from a distribution.

2.  Fixed *effect* (rate). This specifies the response rate difference
    between the treatment arm and the control arm in the Value column.
    Note: FACTS does *not* use the convention that positive effects
    always indicate improvement. I.e., if "Lower response is
    improvement" is specified on the Trial \> Trial Info tab, an
    effective arm should have a negative effect value. If an effect size
    would cause a value to be outside of the range \[0, 1\], then it is
    set at the appropriate boundary.\
    This option is not available for the control arm.

3.  Fixed effect (*log-odds*). This specifies the Value column as the
    difference between the logit of the response rate for the treatment
    arm and logit of the response rate for the control arm.\
    This option is not available for the control arm.

4.  A distribution. Rather than specifying a specific value for the
    response rate, a distribution of values can be chosen. Each
    simulated trial will then have a (possibly) different value for the
    response rate for the arm. Distributions will be available for
    selection in the drop-down menu for the treatment arms, with one
    option for each distribution profile set up on the Virtual Response
    \> Explicitly Defined \> Treatment Distribution sub-tab. If a
    distribution is chosen, the value in the Value column is ignored.\
    If this selection is made for the control arm, the selection is
    called "Sampled", and the distribution is specified on this tab, in
    the "Control Sampled Response Rate" box.

![](./platformattachments/media/image22.png){width="5.998721566054243in"
height="3.9515955818022745in"}

### Treatment Distribution -- Dichotomous Endpoint

This tab is used to set up distribution profiles, so that the arm
response rate is drawn randomly for each simulated trial. Any
distribution profile that is added on this sub-tab will appear as an
option in the drop-down menu for the Response Rate Fixed/Sampled column
in the Arm Response sub-tab. The options here are somewhat expanded
relative to the continuous endpoint version. The user must specify three
components:

1.  Response Rate, Effect (Response Rate), Log-Odds, Effect (Log-Odds).
    This selection determines both whether the value being simulated
    is: a) the rate or log-odds (logit of rate) and b) the actual value
    or an effect - difference from the control arm response. Note: FACTS
    does not use the convention that positive effects always indicate
    improvement. I.e., if "Lower response is improvement" is specified
    on the Trial \> Trial Info tab, an effective arm should have a
    negative value if Effect Size is the selection.

2.  Prob same as control / Prob effect size is 0: The distribution that
    is simulated will be a mixture distribution with a point mass on the
    value of the control arm, and the remaining probability assigned to
    a continuous distribution. This value specifies the probability
    assigned to the point mass. Values of 0 are allowed, meaning that
    only the continuous distribution would be utilized.

3.  The distribution for the continuous portion of the mixture.
    Currently, three distributions types are available.

    a.  The normal distribution, which requires the specification of the
        mean and standard deviation of the distribution -- available
        only for if log-odds or effect (log-odds) is selected in step 1.

    b.  The truncated normal distribution, which requires the
        specification of the mean and standard deviation of the
        (non-truncated) distribution, along with the minimum and maximum
        values that are to be allowed. Note: if the maximum (minimum)
        value is left blank in the gui, the value is interpreted as
        infinity (negative infinity), allowing for one-sided truncation.
        Allowed for all selections in step 1.

    c.  The generalized beta distribution, which requires the
        specification of the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard
        deviation. Note that not all combination of values lead to a
        valid specification of the beta distribution. The mean must be
        between the minimum and maximum, and the standard deviation must
        then be no larger than:\
        $$\sqrt{(Maximum - Mean) \bullet (Mean - Minimum)}
        $$This option is allowed for all selections in step 1.

Note that if the selection in step 1 is Effect (Response Rate), it is
possible to specify a distribution that has support beyond the range of
\[0, 1\] for the response rate (particularly if the control rate is
sampled, since the control rate for any simulation may draw a rate near
the boundary). In this case, the distribution in truncated to ensure a
rate in the range \[0, 1\].

## Dropout Rate

The probability of a subject dropping out before observing their final
endpoint value is provided by arm. There is no longitudinal model, so
Dropouts Per Arm Per Visit cannot be selected.

# Accrual

The Accrual tab provides an interface for specifying accrual profiles;
these define the mean recruitment rate week by week during the trial.
During the simulation, the simulator uses a Poisson process to simulate
the random arrival of subjects with the specified mean accrual rate.

Accrual profiles are list on the left of the screen, as depicted below.
These accrual profiles may be renamed by double-clicking on them, and
typing a new profile name. After creating a profile the user must create
at least one recruitment region. Early in the trial design process,
detailed simulation of the expected accrual pattern is typically not
necessary and a single region with a simple mean accrual rate is
sufficient.

To model more accurately the expected accrual rates over the trial, the
user may specify multiple regions for each accrual profile and
separately parameterize them. Regions are added via the table in the
center of the screen (Figure 7‑1). Within this table, the user may
modify:

-   the peak, mean weekly recruitment rate,

-   the start date (in weeks from the start of the trial) for this
    recruitment region,

-   whether the region will have a ramp up phase and if so when the ramp
    up will be complete (in weeks from the start of the trial).

-   Whether the region will have a ramp down, and if so when the ramp
    down start and when the ramp down will complete (in weeks from the
    start of the trial).

Ramp up/ramp down define simple linear increase/decreases in mean
recruitment rate from the start to the end of the ramp. Note that
simulation of accrual is probabilistic but ramp downs are defined in
terms of time, so even if ramp downs are planned so that at the average
accrual rate they will occur as the trial reaches cap, there is a risk
in simulations when accrual has been slower than average, that ramp
downs occur before the full sample size is reached. It is advisable to
have at least one region that doesn't ramp down to prevent simulations
being unable to complete.

A graph of the recruitment rate of the highlighted region is shown as
well. As the recruitment parameters are changed, the graph will update
to show the time at which full accrual is reached. An accrual profile
that does not reach full accrual is invalid and cannot be used to run
simulations.

In the screenshot above you can see the two step ramp up in accrual from
four regions -- each starting at different offsets into the trial.

Note that the accrual profile graph is only the mean expectation; actual
accrual is simulated using exponential distributions for the intervals
between subjects, derived from the mean accrual profile specified here.
Thus some simulated trials will recruit more quickly than this and some
more slowly.

There are commands to import and export region details from/to simple
external XML files. When importing, the regions defined in the external
file are **added** to the regions already defined, they don't replace
them.

This is an example of a very simple region file defining just one
region:

\<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\>

\<regions\>

\<region\>

\<name\>Region 1\</name\>

\<rate\>5\</rate\>

\<start\>0\</start\>

\<ramp-up /\>

\<ramp-down /\>

\</region\>

\</regions\>

# Quantities of Interest

The Quantities of Interest (QOI) tabs allows the user to specify which
statistical quantities to calculate at each interim, either to ensure
the values are output for perusal and analysis by the user or for use
within the trial design for adaptation or decision making.

These tabs are largely common across the different FACTS Core engines
and so are described in a single document the FACTS Core Design Guide.

There are some things to note for the FACTS Platform Trial simulator.

-   An "Analysis Population" selection is available for QOIs. The
    current options are "All Participants" and "Concurrent Controls."

    -   The "All Participants" selection computes all model quantities
        based QOI calculation can be based on the data from all
        participants in the trial at the time of the analysis,
        regardless of the arm assignment, including arms that are no
        longer active in the trial.

    -   The "Concurrent Controls" selection restricts the database to
        only the treatment arm being evaluated and participants
        randomized to the control arm concurrently with that arm's
        enrolment. The definition of *concurrence* is those participants
        randomized to one of these two arms from the time of analysis
        back to the *start time* of the treatment arm (when the arm
        became available for randomization rather than when the first
        patient was actually randomized), plus a window of time prior to
        that, as input on the Design -\> Control Response tab.

        -   Note: when a final analysis is run for a treatment arm,
            concurrent QOIs for other arms are not computed, though
            final values for any arm that has previously completed will
            appear in the output.

-   For platform trials, there is no need to specify "Decision
    Quantities (Scalars)" as all decisions are made based on the QOI
    evaluated for the arm for which the decision is being made.

-   Pr(Max) in the FACTS Platform Trial simulator comes in 3 versions:

    -   Pr(Max) across all treatments that have been in the trial
        (including treatments that are complete). This might be used in
        a treatment's early futility condition for example.

    -   Pr(Max) across the currently active treatments (treatments
        enrolling and treatments that have finished enrolling but are
        stilling following-up).

    -   Pr(Max) across all the currently randomizing treatments. This
        might be used to guide response adaptive randomization for
        example.

-   Unlike FACTS Core, the Platform Trial simulator does not assign each
    treatment arm an effective dose level, and thus the concept of an
    MED or EDq arm is irrelevant and not available.

-   Predictive probabilities in the Platform Trial simulator are
    restricted to predictions for future trials, precisely as defined
    for FACTS Core (prediction of a separate trial with 1:1
    treatment:control randomization). Within-trial predictive
    probabilities are not currently implemented.

-   P-values do not offer Bonferroni or Dunnett's adjustments.

# Design

The Design tab sets up prior distributions for the parameters,
determines the participant allocation scheme, and establishes
decision-making timing and criteria.

## Control Response

This sub-tab is used to set up the normal prior distribution for the
control arm. All arms are modeled independently.

## Treatment Response

This sub-tab is used to set up the prior distribution for the treatment
arms and for the common standard deviation of the response. All
treatment means are modeled independently. The user can specify a single
normal prior that applies to each treatment arm or specify normal priors
individually for each treatment arm.

This tab also contains the prior distribution for the standard deviation
of the responses. The variance is modeled as an inverse-gamma
distribution.

This tab also contains the method for handling missing data due to
dropouts. Since longitudinal modeling is not yet implemented, the only
method that currently applies is BOCF, if baseline data is simulated.
Without longitudinal modeling to incorporate post-baseline visit data,
the Bayesian multiple imputation from post-baseline method will ignore
dropouts.

## Allocation

A radio button at the top of the Allocation sub-tab allows choice
between the two options for specifying arm allocation in the Platform
Trial simulator.

### Fixed Allocation

A radio button allows a choice between two options for fixed allocation.

-   *Constant proportion allocated to control*. For this option, the
    proportion of participants that are allocated to the control arm
    remains constant, regardless of the number of treatment arms that
    are active in the trial. The user specifies the number of control
    participants and treatment participants per sub-block. A full block
    consists of a number of sub-blocks corresponding to the number of
    active treatment arms being allocated. Within each sub-block, the
    number of control participants is fixed, while the participants for
    any particular active treatment arm may be spread across the
    sub-blocks.

-   *Allocation dependent on the number of treatments*. For this option,
    the proportion allocated to the control arm is allowed to vary
    depending on the number of active treatment arms in the trial. For
    each potential number of active treatment arms, the user specifies
    the allocation to treatments and control by specifying Y and X for
    that allocation Y:Y:...:Y:X. That is, each treatment arm gets an
    equal number of participants per block, while the control has a
    (possibly) different allocation.

![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically
generated](./platformattachments/media/image28.png){width="6.059695975503062in"
height="3.6782327209098864in"}

### Adaptive Allocation

A radio button allows a choice between two options for adaptive
allocation.

-   *Constant proportion allocated to control*. This option works
    similarly to the Fixed Allocation version, with constant proportion
    allocated to the control arm, and the block allocation is broken
    into sub-blocks with fixed numbers of controls per sub-block. The
    remaining slots (i.e., the number of active arms times the
    "allocation to treatments per sub-block") are allocated to arms
    using response-adaptive randomization.

-   *Allocation dependent on the number of treatments*. For this option,
    the proportion allocated to the control arm is allowed to vary
    depending on the number of active treatment arms in the trial. For
    each potential number of active treatment arms, the user specifies
    the allocation to treatments and control for each block by
    specifying Y and X for that allocation Y:X of treatment to control.
    In this case (differing from the fixed allocation version), Y is the
    *total* allocation to treatment arms that are being adaptively
    allocated to.

The response-adaptive randomization (RAR) follows the same scheme as
FACTS Core with respect to specifying the quantity(ies) of interest to
use in determining allocation by arm. However, one important difference
is the definition of the burn-in period.

Unlike FACTS Core, the burn-in period applies to each treatment arm
separately rather than to the beginning of the trial.

The fixed allocation period for each treatment arm is specified at the
bottom of the Allocation sub-tab. A treatment arm is not part of the RAR
scheme until this number of participants have been enrolled *and* an
analysis has been run to update the relevant QOIs. This latter aspect is
distinct from FACTS Core, where an analysis is always run as soon as the
allocation burn-in period has completed. The user may need to consider
this aspect when determining how interim timing is to be set up. While
in the burn-in phase, a treatment arm is allocated a fixed 1/T ratio of
the adaptive allocation slots, where T is the number of active treatment
arms.

height="4.023417541557305in"}

## Interims

The Interims sub-tab is used to specify the timing of trial update
analyses and to specify which set of stopping criteria (if any) are to
be applied at the update.

![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically
generated](./platformattachments/media/image30.png){width="6.006462160979877in"
height="4.001898512685914in"}

### Update Frequency

Trial updates can be specified by time, information, a mixture of time
and information, or by milestones reached.

Information is defined in the same way as FACTS Core, either by number
of participants enrolled, number of participants with complete data (at
a particular visit when longitudinal modeling is used), or number of
participants who have had the opportunity to provide complete data (at a
particular visit when longitudinal modeling is used). This definition of
information is used for milestones as well as (optionally) update
timing.

There are two distinct modes for trial update timing. A radio button
toggles between "Updates occur whenever a treatment milestone is met"
and "Updates occur on a regular schedule". The former option is only
available if Fixed Allocation is chosen on the Design \> Allocation
sub-tab.

-   *Updates occur whenever a treatment milestone is met*. In this mode,
    the only time an analysis is performed is when a treatment arm
    reaches a milestone -- i.e. when a particular level of information
    has been reached, as specified in the Treatment Milestones portion
    of the sub-tab. The analysis will include all patients enrolled up
    to that point in time and provide model output for all arms, but
    decisions will be made only for the treatment arm whose milestone
    triggered the analysis. An analysis will also occur if a treatment
    arm has reached full follow-up on its maximum number of enrolled
    participants.

-   *Updates occur on a regular schedule*. In this mode, analyses are
    performed on a regular schedule based on time or information at the
    trial level (based on all participants). The timing of the first
    update can be specified as either time from the start of the trial
    or a fixed level of information. If adaptive allocation is being
    utilized, it may begin after this first analysis, provided that at
    least one individual treatment arm burn-in has been reached. After
    the first update, updates can be specified to occur at either fixed
    time intervals or after a fixed incremental level of information has
    accrued.\
    An exception to the regular schedule is that an analysis is always
    performed whenever a treatment arm has reached its time for a final
    analysis. When this happens, an "off-schedule" trial update is
    performed, but no actions are taken except for the declaration of
    success or futility for the completed arm.\
    Note that in this mode, it is possible for treatment milestones to
    be skipped. E.g. if milestones were set up to occur at enrollment of
    30, 55, and 80 participants, it is possible that a treatment arm
    could have 20 participants enrolled at one trial update and 60
    participants at the next. If this were the case, any decisions
    associated with milestone 1 would be skipped and milestone 2
    decisions would be evaluated instead.\
    Within this mode, further input from the user is required, using the
    radio buttons in the Treatment Milestones box:

    -   *Evaluate milestone criteria at each update*. With this
        selection, decisions associated with a particular milestone may
        be evaluated more than once. E.g., suppose milestones occurred
        at enrollment of 30 and 55 participants, and at a trial update
        with 32 participants enrolled, an early futility decision was
        evaluated. At the next trial update, if only 50 participants are
        enrolled, the early futility decision associated with milestone
        1 would be re-evaluated with the updated model results.

    -   *Evaluate milestone criteria when milestone first reached*. With
        this selection, a given milestone can be evaluated at most once
        -- the first time it is reached (if a higher milestone hasn't
        already been reached). In the example above, there would be no
        futility evaluation at 50 participants because the milestone had
        already been evaluated to 32 participants.

### Subject Follow-up Options

The follow-up options mimic those of FACTS Core. However, in the
Platform Trial simulator, the follow-up decision applies only to those
participants that were allocated to the arm that is being stopped.
Control participants and participants on other treatment arms continue
to be followed.

## Success/Futility Criteria

The success/futility criteria sub-tab is used to specify the rules for
early stopping and final evaluation. The basic structure of defining
criterion with a QOI, a direction, and a threshold follows the
conventions used in FACTS Core. However, the Platform Trial Simulator
has some differences and additions, as outlined below.

![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically
generated](./platformattachments/media/image31.png){width="6.069446631671041in"
height="3.4388648293963255in"}

Early stopping criteria can be set up for each milestone defined on the
Design \> Interims sub-tab. Use the Create button to add a sub-tab for
early stopping for a chosen milestone. There are check-boxes to indicate
if early futility or early success should be evaluated at the milestone.
If the same decision criteria are to be used for multiple consecutive
milestones, then only the first in the series needs to be created, and
subsequent milestones will use the criteria until a new milestone
decision rule applies. E.g., if the first and second milestones use
early futility with the same stopping criteria, while early success is
not allowed until the third milestone, the user need only set up the
Milestone 1 and Milestone 3 criteria. For convenience, the "Copy from"
button can be used to copy all criteria from a different milestone. The
Final Evaluation criteria are applied for a treatment arm only if: 1)
the treatment arm has enrolled participants and followed up its maximum
number of participants, or 2) the treatment arm had previously hit an
early stopping criteria and has completed all expected follow-up on its
participants.

One fundamental difference from FACTS Core in setting up a decision
criterion is that all QOIs are available, not the scalar "Decision QOIs"
that FACTS Core uses. The value utilized is always the one corresponding
to the treatment arm whose milestone is being evaluated.

The Platform Trial simulator also allows for differential specification
of evaluation criteria by treatment arm. Any criteria that are specified
on the "All Treatments" sub-tab apply to each treatment arm, and only on
this sub-tab can the checkboxes for early stopping be checked. The
combination of "All Treatments" criteria are combined with the criteria
for an individual treatment in the following way.

-   The criteria on the "All Treatments" tab are combined with the
    AND/OR as specified on that tab to determine an "All Treatments"
    TRUE or FALSE.

-   The criteria on the individual treatment arm's tab are combined with
    the AND/OR as specified on that tab to determine an individual
    treatment arm TRUE or FALSE.

-   The "All Treatments" and individual treatment results are then
    combined differently for early success or futility:

    -   For success, the two are combined with an AND -- both must be
        met (as typically a specific treatment arm would be allowed to
        have a stricter rule for success but not a laxer rule).

    -   For futility, the two are combined with an OR -- either can be
        met (as typically a specific treatment arm might be allowed more
        leeway to withdraw from a trial).

# Simulation

The Simulation tab allows the user to execute simulations for each of
the scenarios specified for the study. The user may choose the number of
simulations, whether to execute locally or on the Grid, and modify the
random number seeds, Figure 11‑1.

N.B. Each time the FACTS application opens, the "Number of Simulations"
will be set to the number of simulations last run for this design. If
completed results are available, the *actual* number of simulations run
for each scenario is reported in the 'Num Sims' column of the results
table. The value displayed in the "Number of Simulations" control is the
number of simulations that *will be* run if the user clicks on the
'Simulate' button.

Note also that if a scenario uses an external VSR file or directory of
external files[^2], the number of simulations will be rounded down to
the nearest complete multiple of the number of VSR lines or external
files. Unless the number of simulations requested 'S' is less than the
number of VSR lines or external files, in which case just the first S
are run. Finally note that the simulations will be performed in packets
such that each packet only uses one external VSR line or file, so packet
sizes may be smaller than requested.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically

height="4.65500656167979in"}

N.B. FACTS uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in the generation of
simulated patient response data and trial results. In order to exactly
reproduce a statistical set of results, it is necessary to start the
Markov Chain from an identical "Random Seed". The initial random seed
for FACTS simulations is set from the simulation tab, the first thing
that FACTS does is to draw the random number seeds to use at the start
of each simulation. It is possible to re-run a specific simulation, for
example to have more detailed output files generated, by specifying
'start at simulation'.

## Number of simulations and packet size.

-   Number of simulations is the number of times to simulate each
    scenario.

-   Start at simulation, should normally be left as '1', unless you want
    to reproduce a specific simulation from a previous run -- which can
    be useful for debugging. Say the 999^th^ simulation out of a larger
    set of simulations displayed some unusual behavior, in order to
    understand why, one might want to see the individual interim
    analyses for that simulation (the "weeks" file), the sampled patient
    results for that simulation (the "Patients" files) and possibly even
    the MCMC samples from the analyses in that simulation. You can save
    the .facts file with a slightly different name (to preserve the
    existing simulation results), then run 1 simulation of the specific
    scenario, specifying that the simulations start at simulation 999
    and that at least 1 weeks file, 1 patients file and the MCMC samples
    file (see the "MCMC settings" dialog) are output.

<!-- -->

-   The parallelization packet size, this allows simulation jobs to be
    split into runs of no-more than the specified number of trials to
    simulate. If more simulations of a scenario are requested than can
    be done in one packet, the simulations are started as the requisite
    number of packets and the results combined and summarized when they
    are all complete -- so the final results files look just as though
    all the simulations were run as one job or packet. FACTS tries to
    set a sensible default size given the overall number of simulations
    to be run.

-   When running simulations on the local machine FACTS enterprise
    version will process as many packets in parallel as there are
    execution threads on the local machine. The overhead of
    packetization is quite low so a packet size of 10 to 100 can help
    speed up the overall simulation process -- threads used to simulate
    scenarios that finish quicker can pick up packets for scenarios that
    take longer, if the number of scenarios is not directly divisible by
    the number of threads packetization uses all threads until the last
    few packets have to be run and finally the "Simulations complete"
    figure can be updated at the end of each packet, so the smaller the
    packet the better FACTS can report the overall progress.

## Random Number Seed

Even a small change in the random seed will produce different simulation
results.

By default the same random number seed is used at the start of the
simulation of each scenario - the "Same seed for all scenarios" option.
This can lead to a degree of correlation between the simulation results
of different scenarios,

If two identical scenarios are specified then identical simulation
results will be obtained. The same may happen if scenarios or designs
only differ in ways that have no impact on the trials being simulated,
for instance designs that have no adaptation, or scenarios that don't
trigger any adaptation (e.g. none of the simulations stop early).

At times this can be useful. But it can also be misleading, to disable
this feature select the "Different seed" option.

## MCMC Settings

To set advanced settings for simulation, the user may click the "MCMC
Settings" button, which will display a number of additional specifiable
parameters for simulation in a separate window.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](./platformattachments/media/image32.png){width="2.6092705599300086in"
height="2.2039446631671042in"}

The first two values specify two standard MCMC parameters --

-   The length of burn-in is the number of the initial iterations whose
    results are discarded, to allow the MCMC chain to reach its
    equilibrium distribution.

-   The number of samples is the number of subsequent iterations whose
    results are recorded in order to give posterior estimates of the
    values of interest.

An additional MCMC parameter controls the sampling within sampling when
the analysis includes imputation from a longitudinal or predictor model:

-   The third parameter controls the number of MCMC samples taken
    between each imputation of missing data using the longitudinal
    model, the default value is 1. This parameter only has an effect if
    Bayesian imputation is being used to impute a significant proportion
    of your data. This allows the parameter estimates to converge
    somewhat for each set of imputed data, if the imputed data is only a
    small percentage of the overall data this is unnecessary. As a rough
    guide, if it at some early interims \> 5% of the data being analyzed
    will be imputed, a value in the range 2 to 10 is recommended to
    avoid underestimating the uncertainty. A higher number should be
    used the greater the proportion of imputed data.

The last two parameters concern the output of the MCMC samples to a log
file:

-   It is possible to have the design engine output the sampled values
    in the MCMC, in all of the interims of the first N simulated trials
    of each scenario by specifying the "Number of MCMC files to output"
    (setting N \> 0). The resulting files, 'mcmcNNNN.csv', will be in
    the results directory with all the other results files for that
    scenario.

-   It is also possible to reduce the size of these files by specifying
    a "thinning parameter".

## Output files

The user can specify:

-   The number of simulations for which 'Weeks' files and 'Patients'
    files are written.

    -   'Weeks' files record the data, analysis and recommendation at
        each interim.

    -   'Patients' files record the patient responses simulated for the
        trial.

## To run simulations

Click in the check box in each of the rows corresponding the to the
scenarios to be run. FACTS displays a row for each possible combination
of the 'profiles' that have been specified: - baseline response, dose
response, longitudinal response, accrual rate and dropout rate. Or
simply click on "Select All".

Then click on the "Simulate" button.

During simulation, the user is prevented from modifying any parameters
on any other tab of the application. This safeguard ensures that the
simulation results reflect the parameters specified in the user
interface.

When simulations are started, FACTS saves all the study parameters, and
when the simulations are complete all the simulation results are saved
in results files in a "\_results" folder in the same directory as the
".facts" file. Within the "\_results" folder there will be a sub-folder
that holds the results for each scenario.

## How many simulations to run?

-   After first entering a design it is worth running just a small
    number of simulations such as 10, to help check that the scenarios
    and design have been entered correctly. Things to check might be: a)
    making sure treatments seem to be entering the trial on a reasonable
    schedule (the "Per Sim: Arm and Participant Arrivals" graph can be
    useful in checking this), b) making sure the overall trial is
    stopping for the expected reason, c) the true response values match
    what was expected from the virtual response entries, d) milestones
    are being evaluated when expected.

-   Once the overall structure looks generally correct, it is usually
    worth quickly collecting rough estimates of the operating
    characteristics using around 100 simulations for each scenario. This
    amount is often enough to spot designs with very poor operating
    characteristics such as very high false positive rates, false
    negative rates, or over-enrolling arms that should stop early.

-   Once operating characteristics appear to be in a reasonable range,
    one might typically need 1,000 or more simulations of each scenario
    to better quantify operating characteristics. When the Virtual
    Response is using distributions, the number of simulations might
    need to be even higher, if one wants to identify operating
    characteristics over the full range of virtual responses, since some
    simulations may contain no virtual responses in a particular range.

> The final number of simulations needed depends greatly on the
> operating characteristics one is focused on. If interest lies
> primarily in time to first success, this goal may require far less
> precision than, say, strict false positive rate control for a
> particular arm.

## What packet size to use?

You must specify a packet size that is a factor of the number of
simulations per scenario to run; this offers the following benefits:

-   If running locally a small packet size allows the simulation of an
    individual scenario to be divided between the different number of
    CPUs in your laptop or PC. This is beneficial because often some
    scenarios are quicker to simulate (e.g. they often stop early) than
    others**;** if simulations were being divided between cores simply
    at the scenario level, this would lead to idle cores, once the
    simulations had completed. Additionally if the number of cores did
    not directly divide into the number of scenarios there would be
    cores idle as the last scenarios were simulated.

-   The "Simulations completed" count will be updated more frequently.

-   If running on a grid then having a small packet size means the job
    can be distributed over more nodes in the grid and thus completed
    more quickly.

Note, the overhead of creating the packets and re-combining the results
is low compared to the time to run the simulations.

Packet sizes of between 10 (when running 100 simulations) and 100 (when
running 10000 simulations) are recommended.

Care should be taken when packetizing a scenario that includes an
external data file to supply the virtual patient responses; in this
situation, a of copy of the external file is included *in each packet*
which can cause the packetisation process to run out of memory as the
packets are being created. In this case, use a smaller number of larger
packets, such as packets that are 1/10^th^ of the total number of
simulations.

## FACTS Grid Simulation Settings

A user with access to a computational grid, may choose to run
simulations on the grid instead of running them locally. This frees the
user's computer from the computationally intensive task of simulating so
that they can continue other work or even shutdown their PC or laptop.
In order to run simulations on the grid, it must first be configured,
this is normally done via a configuration file supplied with the FACTS
installation by the IT group responsible for the FACTS installation.

## Simulation Results and "Show Other Columns"

In the center of the simulation tab, the summary simulation results are
displayed. The individual columns are listed ans described below in
Section 12. There are many columns of results, these are now organized
into related groups of sub-windows, which can be displayed by clicking
on the "Show other Columns" button.

    -   Model parameters

-   Simulation results: Opens a window that displays the individual
    simulation results for that scenario. The results initially
    displayed are the 'highlights' columns, similarly to the summary
    results (see below) the results columns are collected into
    sub-groups, windows of these subgroups can be opened from the Right
    Click menu of the Simulation Results highlights window.

-   Simulation Duration: Opens a window that displays run-time
    information.

-   Show Per Scenario Graphs: Opens the FACTS graph control displaying
    the graphs for that scenario. See section 14 for details.

-   Show Across Scenario Graphs: Opens the FACTS graph control
    displaying the graphs comparing all scenarios.

-   Compare Scenarios in Airship: Opens the R AIRSHIP package for
    comparing results across scenarios, see the AIRSHIP User Guide for
    details.

-   Open Results Folder: Open a new Windows directory browser window
    showing the contents of the simulation results for that scenario.

-   Copy to Clipboard: Copies all the rows of the summary to the
    clipboard, as tab-delimited text.

-   Open in R: Opens R, loading in the result files for the currently
    selected scenario as separate data-frames (doesn't load the
    aggregated files if they exist, for that use the "Open in R"
    button).

-   Design Report: Create a design report (a word document describing
    the design), see the Design Report User Guide for details.

## Double Click

Double clicking on a row of simulation results opens a window listing
the results of each individual simulation for that scenario. See section
15 below for a description.

    clipboard, as tab-delimited text.

## Open in R

If aggregated results files have been created, then the Open in R button
will start R and load the aggregated '.csv' files.

If there are no aggregated files then the results files of the currently
selected scenario are loaded. R can also be opened in this fashion by
right clicking on a row in the simulation results table.

When FACTS starts R it writes out an R auto run startup script that
loads the csv files into R as separate dataframes.

## Aggregation

Aggregation combines the csv output from multiple scenarios into fewer
csv files. The Aggregate... button displays a dialog which allows the
user to select what to aggregate.

![](./platformattachments/media/image36.png){width="5.177083333333333in"
height="4.281936789151356in"}

The default location for the aggregated files is the results directory
for the study, but this can be changed.

Aggregation may be performed with or without pivoting on group, or both.

-   Unpivoted files will have one row for each row in the original
    files.

-   In pivoted files each original row will be split into one row per
    dose.

    -   Where there is a group of columns for each dose, they will be
        turned into a single column with each value on a new row.

    -   Values in columns that are independent of dose will be repeated
        on each row.

The default is to aggregate all scenarios, but any combination may be
selected.

Pressing "Aggregate" generates the aggregated files.

Each type of csv file is aggregated into a separate csv file whose name
begins agg\_ or agg_pivot\_, so agg_summary.csv will contain the rows
from each of the summary.csv files, unpivoted. WeeksNNNNN.csv files are
aggregated into a single agg\_\[pivot\_\]weeks.csv file.
PatientsNNNNN.csv files are aggregated into a single agg_patients.csv
file, but they are never pivoted because each row already refers to a
single dose.

RegionIndex.csv is not aggregated.

Each aggregated file begins with the following extra columns, followed
by the columns from the original csv file:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Column Name          Comments
  -------------------- --------------------------------------------------
  Scenario ID          Index of the scenario

  Recruitment Profile  A series of columns containing the names of the
                       various profiles used to construct the scenario.
                       Columns that are never used are omitted (e.g.
                       External Subjects Profile if there are no external
                       scenarios)

  Dropouts Profile

  Virtual Response
  Profile

  Treatment Arm
  Arrival Profile

  Agg Timestamp        Date and time when aggregation was performed

  Sim                  Simulation number. Only present in weeks and
                       patients files.

  Treatment            Treatment Arm. Only present if pivoted.

## Design Report

This button becomes enabled once there are simulation results, it uses
an R script and R libraries to generate a MS Word document describing
the design.

See the FACTS Design Report User Guide for details of what R packages
need installing, how FACTS needs configuring to use the correct R
instance, how the generate_report() function is run, and where the
resulting report can be found.

# The summary results columns

These are the columns displayed on the simulations tab after simulations
are completed. They can also be displayed in the separate "Highlights"
results window.

# Graphs of Simulation Results

To enable swift visualization and analysis of the simulation results,
FACTS has a number of pre-defined graphs it can display. Full and
detailed simulation results are available in 'csv' format files that can
be loaded into other analysis tools allowing any aspect of the
simulation to be explored. These files are described in Section 17
below.

## Per Scenario Graphs

To view the graphs of the results of the simulations of a particular
design variant in a particular scenario, select that row of scenario
results by clicking on it and then click on the 'View Graph' button and
select "Show Per Scenario Graphs".

The graph display supports copying an image of the graph to the
clipboard, to facilitate pasting them into documents and presentations.
Right clicking on a graph brings up a short menu that allows the image
of the graph to be copied to the clipboard or saved in '.png' format to
a file.

Many graphs have a number of controls to allow the graph to be tailored,
standard graph controls available on most graphs are:

-   Set Y axis -- this displays a dialog boxing allowing the user to fix
    the minimum and maximum of each of the Y axes and the number of
    'tick' marks. (Not displayed if the 'y' value must lie in the
    interval 0-1.

-   Show Truth -- this toggles whether the true response by arm is
    plotted.

## Box and whisker plot conventions

-   The mean probability is plotted as a large dot.

-   The median value is plotted as a dashed line.

-   The 25-75^th^ quantile range is plotted as the "box" portion of each
    point.

-   The "whiskers" extend to the largest and smallest values within 1 ½
    times the interquartile range from either end of the box.

-   Points outside the whisker range are considered outliers, and are
    plotted as small blue dots. Note that it may be difficult to see all
    of these symbols if they are plotted at the same value.

# Per Scenario Graphs

## Outcome by Treatment

![](./platformattachments/media/image37.png){width="4.745667104111986in"
height="3.438066491688539in"}

This graph summarizes the final status of each treatment arm in the
trial, including availability, completeness, and conclusion. The "Trt.
Classification" drop-down menu in the Controls box allows the user to
specify whether the plot should be restricted to treatment effects with
a particular classification.

## Simulated Treatment Classification

![](./platformattachments/media/image38.png){width="4.752534995625547in"
height="3.4414905949256345in"}

This graph summarizes the treatment effect classification of each
treatment arm in the trial. If no sampling is used for treatment arms,
these bars will all be one solid color, but may show variation if either
the control arm or the arm itself is sampled. The classification into
"good," "unacceptable," and "mediocre" uses the definitions provided on
the Virtual Response \> Treatment Classification tab. The "General
Outcome" drop-down menu in the Controls box allows the user to restrict
the plot to treatment arms that reached a particular outcome. For
example, choosing "Success" will show the distribution of treatment
classifications for the arms only amongst arms that achieved a "Early
Success," "Late Success," or "Futility to Success Flip" outcome.

## Allocation Box and Whisker Plot

![](./platformattachments/media/image39.png){width="4.738669072615923in"
height="4.6941590113735785in"}

This graph displays a box and whisker plot of the number of subjects
enrolled into each arm. These plots show:

-   The distribution over all simulations of the number of subjects
    allocated to each arm shown as a box and whisker plot. In certain
    types of non-adaptive trials, the number may be the same in every
    simulation and the box and whiskers collapse to a single line.

## Response and Participant Allocation

![](./platformattachments/media/image40.png){width="4.7491010498687665in"
height="4.6941590113735785in"}

This graph shows for each treatment arm, the mean subject allocation,
mean response and the 2.5%-97.5% boundaries of the estimated means over
the simulations.

-   The blue bars show the mean number of subjects allocated.

-   The black dot-and-whisker shows the distribution of the true mean
    response across the simulations, as 2.5%, 50%, and 97.5% quantiles.
    This will only be a black dot if the response is fixed.

-   The green dot-and-whisker shows the distribution of the estimated
    response across the simulations, as 2.5%, 50%, and 97.5% quantiles.

## Per Treatment: QOIs

![](./platformattachments/media/image41.png){width="5.08288823272091in"
height="5.027997594050744in"}

These plots show box and whisker plots to display the distribution
(across the simulations) of the final values for the QOIs. The drop-down
menu in the Controls panel allows the user to change which QOI is
displayed.

## Cumulative Operating Characteristics Plot

![A graph with a line Description automatically
generated](./platformattachments/media/image42.png){width="3.2680555555555557in"
height="3.1862073490813647in"}![A graph on a screen Description

generated](./platformattachments/media/image43.png){width="3.271329833770779in"
height="3.1952537182852145in"}

There are two graphs, one that shows the cumulative proportion of
durations across all simulations, and the other shows the cumulative
proportion of subjects across all simulations.

## Time Course for Stopping

There are two graphs, one that shows the distribution over time for
stopping for futility and one for stopping for success.

  height="2.6045395888014in"}                                                  height="2.605594925634296in"}
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Figure 5‑4 Adding a link to R

These graphs show the cumulative proportion of simulations that a
treatment arm stopped for futility or success on the y-axis. On the
Controls panel, the user can specify which treatment arm to display, and
toggle the x-axis between time (in weeks) from the start of the trial or
the number of participants enrolled on the treatment arm. If the
simulated trial has success-to-futility (or futility-to-success)
flip-flops, a separate line is drawn for the cumulative proportion of
those outcomes.

## Per Sim Graphs

The Per Sim graphs allow the user to select a particular Simulation to
examine in detail. The simulation number is selected in the Controls
box.

height="4.908436132983377in"}

graph

### Per Sim: Arm and Participant Arrivals

![](./platformattachments/media/image47.png){width="5.119104330708661in"
height="5.078448162729659in"}

This graph depicts an overview of a single simulated trial, providing
timing information (in weeks). The graph contains several components:

-   A dashed line from the time that the arm became available for entry
    into the trial until the time time that it either entered the trial
    (began enrolling) or stopped waiting to enter the trial and
    withdrew. Note: if the arm began enrolling as soon as it became
    available, the dashed line will not appear.

-   A thick solid line from the beginning to end of the enrollment
    period.

-   A dot-dashed line from the end of enrollment to the time of final
    analysis. If there is no follow-up after an early stopping decision
    is made, then this line will not appear.

-   A symbol at the end of each treatment arm's line indicating the
    final status of the treatment arm.

-   A symbol above the final status symbol indicating the treatment
    effect classification.

-   Optionally, checking the "Show Participant Arrivals" checkbox in the
    Controls box will add additional lines to the plot: number of
    participants accrued versus time.

### Per Sim: Response and Participant Alloc.

![](./platformattachments/media/image48.png){width="4.741373578302712in"
height="4.690060148731408in"}

This graph mimics the other Response and Participant Allocation graph
but is for a single simulation, as selected in the Controls box. In this
graph, the ochre dot-and-whiskers represent a 95% credible interval for
the response, based on the Bayesian model fit, while the green
dot-and-whiskers represents a frequentist 95% confidence interval for
the response.

### Per Sim: Posterior Quantities

![](./platformattachments/media/image49.png){width="4.741373578302712in"
height="4.672954943132108in"}

This graph mimics the Per Sim Response and Participant graph but
replaces the enrollment bar chart with a bar chart for a QOI value at
the trial's final analysis. The QOI Value to display is chosen via a
drop-down menu in the Controls box.

## Per Update Graphs

These graphs mimic previous graphs but allow the user to look at
quantities as of a specific trial update within a simulation. The user
can select the simulation and update in the Controls box. The updates
are labeled with both the number of the trial update and the time (week)
in which the update took place. Note: final analyses for arms at the end
of follow-up are considered updates for the purpose of this numbering,
though they may have no adaptive decisions associated.

The per update graphs are only available for those simulations for which
'weeks' files have been output (by default the first 100).

height="4.570314960629921in"}

Controls to select the individual simulation and interim for which the
results are to be displayed

### Per Update: Allocation Probability

The only new graph in the per update set is the allocation probability
graph. This graph is intended primarily to examine the behavior of
adaptive allocation but can also be used to see which arms are enrolling
and how allocation changes with the number of available arms even in the
non-adaptive allocation case. This graph is identical to the Per Update:
Response and Participant Allocation graph, except that in place of a bar
chart for *past* enrollment, it gives the current probability of
allocation for the arms.

![](./platformattachments/media/image51.png){width="4.734082458442694in"
height="4.672954943132108in"}

## Explore graphs

Two graphs, one for futility and one for success, are available to help
calibrate a design. For a particular treatment arm and a particular QOI,
the line graph displays the proportion of simulated trials for which the
QOI exceeds (or falls below) a threshold, indicating a potential way to
set up early stopping rules to achieve desired operating
characteristics.

These graphs require the use of weeks files to get detailed information
updates, so it may be critical to increase the number of weeks files
saved (as set on the Simulation tab, defaulting to 100) to provide
sufficient information in these graphs.

Since the graphs rely on the existing simulations, then any early
stopping that is applied will limit the data available for later
interims, and make the data conditional on not stopping early, which may
make interpretation difficult. Thus, it may better to run simulations
with no early stopping when utilizing these graphs. However, unlike the
Core engine where removing early stopping lead to identical results up
to the stopping point of interest, removing early stopping from all arms
may affect the trajectory of the platform trial, leading to fewer arms
enrolling, a difference in proportion of controls, and other changes in
behavior of the platform trial beyond the early stopping of arms. The
graphs may provide rough estimates of where thresholds should be set,
but ultimately, these will need to be calibrated in the context of early
stopping for all arms.

# Across Scenario Graphs

## Select Scenarios and Variants to Display

The "Across Scenarios" displays a number of different graph types in a
grid. Graphs of different scenarios are arranged horizontally and graphs
of different variants are arranged vertically (see section 6.3 for
details of defining variants).

This control allows you to filter which scenarios and which variants are
to be included.

height="3.129387576552931in"}

The control simply presents a list of the scenarios and a list of the
variants, with a checkbox alongside each one allowing it to be
de-selected:

## QOI Box Plots

This graph shows a box and whisker plot for each scenario and variant
selected. Each plot shows the distribution of the values of a selected
QOI for each arm. There is a drop down control to allow the selection of
the QOI to be displayed. Any Posterior probability, Predictive
probability, p-value or target QOI can be selected.

# Detailed Simulation Results

After simulation has completed and simulation results have been loaded,
the user may examine detailed results for any scenario with simulation
data in the table by double-clicking on the row. A separate window (as
in Figure 15‑1) displays the individual results for each simulation.
This is the contents of the "simulations.csv" file, which is described
below. The simulations results are partitioned into the same various
results groupings as the summary results. These can be accessed from the
"right click" menu, along with opening the results folder, opening the
weeks file for a particular simulation and opening the simulated
patients file for a particular simulation (where a "weeks" file or a
"patients" file has been output).

![](./platformattachments/media/image57.png){width="5.1412839020122485in"
height="2.896095800524934in"}

# Output Files

FACTS stores the results of simulations as '.csv' files under a Results
folder. For each row in the simulations table, there is a folder named
by the profiles that make up the scenario, which contains the
corresponding '.csv' files.

![](./platformattachments/media/image58.png){width="3.323794838145232in"
height="2.673570647419073in"}

These files can be opened using Microsoft Excel, but versions of Excel
before 2007 are restricted to 256 columns, which is too few to view some
files in their entirety. The 'Calc' application in 'OpenOffice' will
show all the columns (and will open two files that have the same name at
the same time!). Because Excel takes out a file lock on any file it has
open, while a file is open in Excel it cannot be deleted or modified by
another application. The most common cause for an error to be reported
when simulating trials in FACTS is because the user has one of the
previous results files is still open in Excel.

In the scenario directory there are the following types of results file:

**Summary.csv** Contains a single row of data that summarizes the
simulation results. This is the source of the shown on the simulations
tab.

**Simulations.csv** Contains one row per simulation describing the final
state of each simulation for every trial simulated.

**PatientsNNNNN.csv** Contains one row per patient in a simulation,
where NNNNN is the number of the simulation. By default this file is
written out only for the first simulation, but this can be changed on
the simulations tab.

**WeeksNNNNN.csv** Contains one row for each trial update during a
simulation where NNNNN is the number of the simulation. By default this
file is written only for the first 100 simulations, but this can be
changed via the simulation tab. The values in the last row of the
cohorts file will be the same as the final values for that simulation in
the simulations.

## Contents of summary.csv

## Contents of simulations.csv and weeksNNNNN.csv

The simulations.csv file holds the FACTS summary of the last analysis
for each simulation (one per row).

The weeksNNNNN.csv file holds the FACTS summary of every analysis for
the NNNNN^th^ simulation. It contains a row for each update in the trial
and a row for each final analysis that occurs off-cycle from regular
updates.

The first line is a header line, starting with a '#', and containing

-   The FACTS GUI version number

-   The name of the FACTS file

-   The name of the scenario

-   The time stamp of the start of the simulation

The second and third lines are header lines. Most header names are
identical in the second and third lines, but differ for some quantities,
particularly QOIs. The alternate names for QOIs are summarized in the
QOIMappingFile.csv that is produced in the main results directory.

Most of the columns are common to the simulations and weeks file types,
except as noted below.

## Contents of MCMCNNNNN.csv

The MCMC file if requested for output by the user, contains all the MCMC
samples for the fitted parameters in the design. There is one row per
sample (including the burnin) and the samples from all the analyses in
the simulation are included. The first two columns are the analysis
index and the sample (within analysis) index. The remaining columns are
the parameters whose sample values are being reported, the number and
constituents of these columns are highly variable depending on design of
the statistical analysis.

# Mapping Files

When any simulations are run, two files are generated, which are placed
in the top-level "\_results" folder. These files apply to any results
produced for individual scenarios and are intended to help with tracking
the QOIs in use for the simulation.

## QOIMappingFile.csv

This file provides a list of all QOIs that are computed for the
simulations, along with details about the QOI definition. This file
utilizes the same structure as for the Core engine, though it is largely
redundant for the Platform engine, since there is a row for each
treatment for each individual QOI.
