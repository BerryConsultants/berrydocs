#  Introduction

## Purpose of this document

This document describes how use the FACTS Dose Escalation (DE) 2D-CRM
design engine. It is intended for all end users of the system.

## Scope of this document

This document covers the FACTS Dose Escalation 2D-CRM design engine user
interface.

This document does not address the internal workings of the design
engines or algorithms, which are addressed in the associated Design
Engine Specification. It also does not address the use of FACTS Core
Designs or Enrichment Designs, which are covered in other User Guides.

The screenshots provided are specific to a particular installation and
may not reflect the exact layout of the information seen by any
particular user. They were taken from FACTS 6 or later installed on
Windows 10. Different versions of Windows or the use of different
Windows themes will introduce some differences in appearance. The
contents of each tab, however, will be consistent with the software.

## Context of this Issue

This document is a guide to the version 7.0 release of Dose Escalation
FACTS.

## Citing FACTS

If writing in LaTex and using Bibtex, if you wish to cite FACTS (thank
you!), can we suggest the following:

## Definition of Terms

The following acronyms and abbreviations are used in this document.

Cap A limit on the number of subjects recruited. In FACTS N-CRM users
can specify a cap on the overall number of subjects to be recruited in
the trial (the ‘Overall Cap’) and specify stopping rules to define when
the trial should stop before it reaches cap.

Control Is the treatment arm with which the novel treatment(s) are
principally being compared. Control may be placebo, or some existing
standard of care, or therapy, against which the novel treatment has to
be benchmarked in order to determine its likely usefulness.

Core FACTS Core: A mode of FACTS for designing trials where multiple
treatments, (possibly different doses of a novel treatment) are tested
against a control and optionally an active comparator.

CRM Continual Reassessment Method – a dose escalation design where the
dose-toxicity is estimated using a simple Bayesian model, and the
resulting estimates used to control the dose escalation and estimate the
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).

DE Dose Escalation: a mode of FACTS where subjects are treated in
cohorts and dose escalation is determined by the number of toxicities
observed.

ED Enrichment Designs: a mode of FACTS for designing trials where the
same treatment is testing in different settings for example different
sub-populations or different but related indications.

Endpoint An endpoint is a measure of the subject’s health that is being
analyzed in order to learn about the effects of the treatments being
studied in the trial.

FACTS Fixed and Adaptive Clinical Trial Simulator

Final Endpoint The final value, or state, of a subject’s endpoint.

GUI Graphical User Interface, the part of the FACTS application that the
user interacts with.

Method In the FACTS documentation we try to reserve the term ‘method’
for the algorithms used in the simulation (as opposed to the analysis)
part of the program. In the analysis part we use the term ‘Model’, see
below.

Model In the FACTS documentation we try to reserve the term ‘model’ for
the statistical models used in the analysis of the trial data (in the
‘design’ section of the FACTS user interface). Where mathematical
algorithms are used for other purposes in FACTS (for instance in the
generation of the simulated data) we try to use the term ‘method’. We
have found that initially it is very easy for users to be confused
between these two parts of FACTS and we feel that using distinct
terminology may help to reduce this.

MTD The dose most likely to be the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) – the
dose with the highest Pr(MTD).

MTD+ The dose most likely to be the MTD+ – the dose with the highest
Pr(MTD+).

Pr(MTD) A dose’s probability of being MTD is the probability that it is
the dose with the highest probability of having a toxicity rate in the
acceptable toxicity band, and (if a threshold has been specified) does
not have a probability of excess or unacceptable toxicity above the
threshold. This estimate of MTD is constrained to select one of the
available doses.

Pr(MTD+) A doses probability of being the MTD+ is the probability that
it is the dose with the highest probability of having a toxicity rate in
the acceptable band, and (if a threshold has been specified) does not
have a probability of excess or unacceptable toxicity above the
threshold. Unlike Pr(MTD), Pr(MTD+) includes estimating whether a dose
below or a dose above the range of those being tested is more likely to
have a toxicity in the acceptable band than any of the doses in the
range.

Profile A profile is a specification of one aspect of a scenario. A
scenario is made up of one profile of each of the required types for the
type of trial being simulated. FACTS allows the user to specify multiple
profiles of each type and then presents all the possible combinations of
profiles as scenarios that can be used to drive simulations.

Response The change in a subject’s endpoint compared to their baseline
state.

Scenario A scenario is the complete specification of the unknown
external factors that determine the data observed on the trial and its
timing. The exact factors depend on the type of trial being simulated
but typically include:

> the distribution of the final change from base line, or probability of
> response or rate of events in the different treatment groups,
>
> the properties of subjects’ early responses and the correlation with
> their final outcome,
>
> the rate at which subjects are recruited into the trial,
>
> the rate at which subjects drop out of the trial.

SPEC The Design Engine Specification, describes the system algorithms,
and meaning of parameters.

Subject Someone recruited onto a clinical trial for the purposes of
learning about the properties of a treatment. Depending on the type of
trial they might be patients or they might be healthy volunteers.

Treatment Arm Subjects on entering the study are randomized to different
‘treatment arms’. Subjects randomized to the same arm receive the same
treatment and the responses of the subjects in the arm analyzed to
determine the expected response to that treatment, allowing the expected
responses to the different treatments to be compared.

UG The User Guide, describes how to use the system.

# FACTS 2D-CRM Overview

This user guide assumes some limited general familiarity with FACTS and
concentrates on describing the interface for designs using the 2D-CRM
approach. See the FACTS Dose Escalation user guide for a general
introduction to the FACTS Dose Escalation user interface.

The 2D-CRM is based on the method described in the paper
[@neuenschwander2008critical]. It is designed for use in oncology phase 1 trials,
and we understand has been used at Novartis for some trials of this
type:

- Combinations of doses of two drugs are to be tested.

- Dosing starts at a (very) low dose combination, strongly believed to
  be safe.

- Usually after a cohort of subjects have completed their current dose,
  the dose to be used for the next cohort is selected. The selection of
  this dose is dictated by a combination of dose escalation rules, the
  estimate of the toxicity rate on the different doses and the target
  maximum tolerated toxicity, or toxicity band.

- The endpoint per subject is binary: toxicity observed or not.

- There are two predefined sets of doses to explore, one for each drug.
  Not all combinations may be permitted.

- There is limited sample size.

## FACTS 7.0

There have been no changes to 2D-CRM in FACTS 7.0.

## FACTS 6.5

There have been no changes to 2D-CRM in FACTS 6.5.

## FACTS 6.4.1 Changes to 2D-CRM

Compared to 6.4 there have been slight changes to address circumstances
where the model could fail to converge, and parameter estimates could
reach very large values. This was due to wanting to allow 0 doses in
2D-CRM, because in the 2D setting it is sometimes the case that there
have been monotherapy escalation studies and there is a desire to
incorporate this data in the 2D trial. To do this a 0 dose is included
for the other drug so there are monotherapy combinations in the design
(possibly excluded from being actually given during the 2D trial). This
means the posterior parameter estimates from the monotherapy can be used
for that drug’s prior, or the data from the monotherapy trial can be
included as “Prior Toxicities”.

Up to this release (6.4.1) there were two problems doing this:

1.  Inherited from the N-CRM code, FACTS was still storing the logs of
    the dose strengths, so doses could not be 0, and the advice was to
    use small values instead such as 0.001.

2.  The presence of a combination with very small values for the
    transformed dose strength (and now 0 values) causes problems for the
    model’s stability, in particular when the dose strengths are 0 it
    becomes impossible for the model to have anything other than 0 DLT
    rate at the 0,0 combination.

In FACTS 6.4.1 these problems have been addressed by the following
changes:

1.  FACTS now allows 0 strength doses.

2.  It there is any combination where both dose strengths after
    transformation are less than 0.001 then this combination must be
    excluded from the trial and can have no prior toxicities specified
    for it (however prior observations of no toxicities are allowed).

3.  If both drugs include 0 strength doses, the lower asymptote for the
    Response Model (the range is usually \[0, 1\]) must be raised
    slightly, e.g. to 0.0001.

Restrictions 2 and 3 are checked when there is an attempt to run
simulations, and if violated a warning message is displayed and the
simulations not run.

## FACTS 6.4 Changes to 2D-CRM

There were no changes to the 2D-CRM simulator for FACTS 6.4.

## FACTS 6.3 Changes to 2D-CRM

There were no changes to the 2D-CRM simulator for FACTS 6.3.

## The use of the 2D-CRM simulator to design a trial

The typical pattern of use of the simulator is as follows:

- Enter the constraints and objectives of the study: maximum sample size
  and the bounds of the different toxicity bands.

- Select the choice of and overdose control thresholds.

- Specify a small number of expected toxicity responses as VSR
  scenarios.

- Select the desired run-in and dose escalation rules.

- Specify an initial set of priors for the model.

- Run a small number of simulations (25 is usually adequate at this
  stage) of each scenario.

- Check the performance of the design:

  - Do the majority of the final combinations being selected have an
    acceptable level of toxicity?

  - Is the overall level of toxicity observed in the trial acceptable?

  - In the scenarios where the performance is worst, observe the
    behavior in individual simulations.

- Try a number of modifications to the design and simulate each
  modification individually. Increasing the number of simulations
  (usually 100 is still adequate at this stage).

- Consider if more VSRs need to be included to check a greater range of
  possible actual toxicity rate patterns.

- Combine modifications with promising results and re-simulate, (usually
  500 is an adequate number at this stage).

The design changes that are typically considered are:

- Exclude low dose combinations that are certain to be too weak.

- Exclude high dose combinations that are certain to be too toxic.

- Modify the run-in to be more aggressive if it is taking too many
  subjects and cycles to reach the escalation phase.

  - The ”Huang” diagonals method is the least aggressive, both the
    “Ivanova” and “Tri-axial” can skip some combinations, finally
    consider a user specified run-in sequence.

  - The “Huang” and the “Tri-axial” can make use of the “multiple
    simultaneous cohorts” option in the run-in phase to test multiple
    combinations simultaneously.

- If the escalation phase is too aggressive – incurring too many
  toxicities or selecting combinations with high toxicity true toxicity
  too often - then options are:

  - Make the run-in expand at the dose below observed toxicities, not at
    the toxicity

  - Make the priors for the model less informative (if the priors are
    informative and predicting low toxicity at higher combinations), the
    greater uncertainty in the toxicity at higher doses may then result
    in the estimate of their toxicity exceeding the overdose control
    threshold.

  - Make the priors for the model predict higher levels of toxicity.

  - Increase the overdose control thresholds.

  - Shift the toxicity band bounds downwards.

  - Add prior toxicity data.

  - Increase the number of subjects before escalation.

- If the escalation phase is not aggressive enough – selecting
  combinations with too low a toxicity too often - then options are:

  - Make the run-in expand at the dose where toxicity observed not a
    dose below

  - Make the priors for the model more informative (if the priors are
    uninformative) this will allow lack of toxicity on lower doses
    reduce the predicted toxicity at higher, untested doses, bringing
    the probability of toxicity at the higher doses below the dose
    escalation threshold.

  - Make the priors for the model predict lower levels of toxicity.

  - Lower the overdose control thresholds.

  - Shift the toxicity band bounds upwards.

  - Add prior toxicity data.

  - Decrease the number of subjects before escalation.

## General constraints and assumptions 

The design engine is limited to phase 1/2a designs with dichotomous
endpoints toxicity/no-toxicity. There is no longitudinal modeling or
analysis of covariates included. All results of a cohort are assumed to
be available before the next cohort is treated.

## Models and Methods

For a full description of the models and methods implemented in the
2D-CRM see the Software Specification document \[Spec\].

In the current prototype there is a single statistical model used to
analyse the data – the 5 parameter Bayesian Logistic Regression Model as
described in [@neuenschwander2008critical]. The model is used to compute the
posterior probability that the toxicity rate at each combination is in
one of 4 toxicity bands – “underdosing”, “target toxicity”, “excess
toxicity” and “unacceptable toxicity”. The boundaries between the bounds
are settable by the user.

The posterior probability that the rate is in the target toxicity rate
is used to target the dose allocation – the method attempts to allocate
to the Maximum Target Toxicity (MTT). The posterior probability that the
rate is in the “excess toxicity” and “unacceptable” or just the
“unacceptable” bands can be used to enforce an “overdose control”.
Combinations with a posterior probability that exceed the specified
threshold are excluded from selection or allocation.

The dose combinations are explored in two phases:

1)  Optionally the trial may begin with a “small cohort run in” or the
    allocation of a single cohort to a specified combination. This phase
    ends when the sequence of combinations to explore is exhausted or
    excluded by combinations at which toxicities have been observed.
    There is no model fitting during this phase.

2)  The trial then proceeds looking for the dose combination with the
    highest probability of having a toxicity rate in the target toxicity
    range using dose escalation, limited by dose escalation rules.

### Run-in methods

There are 4 run-in methods available:

Contour This explores the reverse diagonals, assuming that the expected
toxicity at the dose increments of the two doses are roughly equal.

Row by row This explores the doses of drug 1 at the first dose of drug
2, then increments drug 2, steps back a specified number of doses in
drug 1 and then increments through the doses of drug 1 again. This
method favours escalation of drug 1 over escalation of drug 2.

Tri-axial This explores the combinations on each axis and on the
diagonal. For small numbers of dose increments it is similar to the
Huang run-in. For larger numbers of dose increments it is more
parsimonious.

Custom This explores a specific sequence of combinations stopping when
the first toxicity is observed or the sequence is completed.

Or run-in can be skipped.

For more details see the Software Specification document \[Spec\].

### Escalation methods

There are 4 escalation methods available. They all work in the same
basic framework:

1.  The dose combinations where sufficient subjects have been tested and
    lesser dose combinations are found.

2.  The dose combinations that can be escalated to beyond these are
    found.

3.  The dose combinations where the overdose control limits are exceeded
    are removed.

4.  The target dose combinations from the remaining set are selected
    according to the selected method.

The 4 methods are:

Contour This explores every MTT on every row and every column
(frequently these overlap, but not necessarily).

Walk This explores the MTT that is at or adjacent to the last
combination tested (excluding the dose that is an increment in both
drugs from the last combination tested).

Tri-axial This explores the MTT on each axis and on the diagonal. Once
these have the required maximum subjects on MTT, any combinations off
the axis and diagonal that are the MTT are explored.

Allocate MTT This allocates to the combination that is the overall MTT
of all the combinations that it is permitted to allocate to.

## Outstanding Issues / Absent Features

Currently the most obvious absent features are:

- modeling of additional endpoints such as efficacy or drug exposure

- the modeling of ordinal toxicity

- the simulation of open enrolment where subjects are allocated on
  subject by subject basis as they become available for enrolment, with
  a limit on the number of subjects who can being treated but for whom
  final endpoint has not been observed.

# Starting FACTS

FACTS is usually first started using the FACTS icon installed on the
Windows desktop or from the Windows Start \> Programs menu.

When the application opens, you are presented with the main introduction
screen of FACTS (**Error! Reference source not found.**). From here you
can start designing a 2D-CRM trial, by double clicking 2D-CRM in the
list of available designs, or by selecting the 2D-CRM design option from
the File \> New \> Dose Escalation menu.

FACTS will also be associated the parameter files it writes out with a
‘.facts’ file extension. Clicking on any one of these files will
automatically start FACTS with that file opened.

Note: Depending on your license, some design options may not be
available.

alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />
<figcaption><p>Figure 3‑1 FACTS introduction screen</p></figcaption>
</figure>

From this screen a new design can be started by selecting the design
type in the list and double clicking it or clicking on the ‘create new’
button at the bottom of the list.

In the ‘Recent Work’ panel, the use can select from the list of most
recently opened FACTS files, or from the list of directories where those
files were located, opening the folder and selecting a FACTS file from
there.

Once a FACTS design has been created, the appropriate FACTS design
module can be launched by double clicking on the “.facts” file in
Windows Explorer.

FACTS information and displays are divided into various tabs (Figure
4‑1). The Study Tab has sub-tabs for Study Information and Treatment
Arms. The Virtual Subject Response, Execution, and Design tabs allow the
user to set additional parameters for simulation. On the Simulation Tab,
the user executes simulations and views the results.

# The FACTS 2D-CRM GUI

The FACTS 2D-CRM GUI conforms to the standard FACTS GUI layout, with
information and displays divided across various standard tabs (Figure
4‑1).

- The Study Tab has sub-tabs for entering Study Information and
  specifying the Treatment Arms (doses) available in the study. This is
  where the user specifies the ‘given’ requirements, or constraints, of
  the trial to be designed.

- The Virtual Subject Response tab has sub-tabs for specifying
  Explicitly Defined response scenarios to simulate and loading External
  data files of simulated subject responses. This is where a set of
  different toxicity rates per dose are specified that should represent
  the expected ‘space’ of the expected dose-toxicity profiles for the
  compound being tested.

- The Design has sub-tabs for specifying the Start-up phase, the Dose
  Escalation phase, the Toxicity Response model and any prior toxicity
  data to include. These are the design choices open to the trial
  biostatistician. The expected consequences of these design choices are
  estimated by running simulations of the trials using the various
  virtual subject response profiles defined.

- On the Simulation Tab, the user controls and runs simulations and can
  view the simulation results.

- On the Analysis tab, the user can use the design to analyze a specific
  data set and report the result of fitting the specified toxicity
  response model and the recommended dose for the next cohort.

<figcaption><p>Figure 4‑1 - Tab layout of FACTS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Also on the menu bar, on the right hand side of the FACTS Window, is a
button labeled “Notes”; clicking this button reveals a simple “notepad”
window in which the user can maintain some simple notes that will be
stored within the “.facts” file.

<figure>

style="width:3.00046in;height:2.22155in" />
<figcaption><p>Figure 4‑3 - Example design notes</p></figcaption>
</figure>

The notepad window comes with two further buttons: one to change the
window to a free floating one that can be moved away from the FACTCS
window; and the other to close it.

The Notes field can be used for any text the user wishes to store with
the file. Suggested uses are: to record the changes made in a particular
version of a design and why; and to comment on the simulation results.
This will help when coming back to work that has been set aside, to
recall what gave rise to the different version of a design.  

# The Standard FACTS Menus

## The ‘File’ Menu

FACTS has a File menu with commands similar to those found in most
Windows applications, but also some unique to FACTS. The commands are:

New Allows the user to select a trial design type and start a new
design; if there are unsaved changes in the current design the user is
prompted to save them first.

Open Allows the user to select an existing FACTS file and open it; if
there are unsaved changes in the current design the user is prompted to
save them first.

Save Saves the current changes in the design to the currently open FACTS
file.

Save As Allows the current version of the design to be saved to a new
FATCS file; this file is then the “currently open” FACTS file going
forward.

Export Project Creates a “Zip” archive containing the current FACTS file
and all the simulation results, so these can be easily archived,
emailed, saved, etc.

Recent Projects Contains entries for the last ten FACTS files opened:
selecting one re-opens it.

Recent Folders Contains entries for the folders that contain the last
ten FACTS files opened: selecting one opens a file browser window on
that folder allowing a ‘.facts’ file in that folder to be selected (or
allowing the user to navigate to some different folder and select a
‘.facts’ file there).

Examples Contains example projects for the different design engines:
selecting one opens it.

Close Closes the current FACTS file, returning the user to the FACTS
introduction screen.

Exit Closes FACTS altogether.

## FACTS Settings Menu

The “Settings” command menu allows the user to do 2 things:

- Set various FACTS options.

- Reset the options to the installation default (those in the
  configuration file)

- Load options from a supplied configuration file.

- Enter a new or changed license key.

### Options

The FACTS Options dialog allows the user to:

- Test the web-service connection to the compute grid or set the grid
  share directory

- Configure the link to R

- Select how gamma distributions are parameterized

#### Grid Configuration

FACTS access to the grid can be implemented using

1.  A Network Shared drive, or

2.  A bespoke FACTS Grid Web Service

The correct grid interface should be selected for your organization,
depending on which grid interface has been implemented, if any.

If using a Network Shared drive, the following should be specified:

- The location of the shared drive – this is usually a server name and
  folder name e.g. [\\factsgrid\share](file://factsgrid/share)

- Whether the grid is running the FACTS engines using Linux or Windows

- The delay in seconds between each poll of the shared drive for
  simulation results once a job has been submitted.

Once the settings have been entered there is a button that initiates a
test to see if the shared drive specified is accessible.

<figcaption><p>Network Share configuration</p></figcaption>
</figure>

If using a Web Service interface:

- The location of the web service endpoint needs to be set.

- Clicking on “Test Configuration” and FACTS will attempt to connect to
  the FACTS grid controller. The control will show which components of
  the connection are working up to the first that isn’t.

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image7.png"

: Webservice Configuration

#### Reset Options

This simply restores all option settings to the users saved values (in
the “user.config” file in the FACTS folder in the users AppData
directory).

#### Load Options

This allows the options settings to be loaded from a supplied file, and
saved as the user’s saved values.

#### R Configuration

In FACTS there are controls that make it simple to launch of R with
simulation results loaded. To enable this to work the user must specify
where the R executable is installed and (if there is more than one
version of R installed) which version of R to use.

style="width:3.33643in;height:4.31408in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />
<figcaption><p>R Configuration Dialog</p></figcaption>
</figure>

The dialog allows the user to Add, Edit, Test and Remove links to
versions of R.

style="width:4.84059in;height:3.75973in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />
<figcaption><p>Adding a link to R</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Clicking on “Add” opens a normal Windows directory browser window, the
user must navigate to the location of an R installation (for example
“C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.2\bin”, select the file R.exe, and click
“Open”. This adds a new entry on the R configuration dialog.

Clicking on “Edit” operates similarly to “Add” above, except the
selected location replaces that currently selected entry on the R
configuration dialog rather than adding a new one.

Clicking on “Test” checks whether the currently selected entry on the R
configuration dialog is available, if it is not an error dialog is
displayed:

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image10.png"
style="width:3.887in;height:1.44195in"
alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" />

Clicking on “Remove” removes the currently selected location on the R
configuration dialog.

The version of R to use by default is selected by clicking on the
‘Active’ check box of the version to use.

#### Gamma Distribution Parameters

In FACTS a number of parameters require inverse gamma distributions to
be specified as priors for the parameter value. There are two different
parameterization of the inverse gamma provided so that the user can
select the form they find the most intuitive.

<figure>

style="width:2.98653in;height:3.86165in"
alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated" />
<figcaption><p>: The parameterisation of Inverse Gamma
Distributions</p></figcaption>
</figure>

The first form uses parameters that are the mean of the distribution and
the equivalent weight in terms of the equivalent number of observations.
The second form uses an ‘Alpha’ and ‘Beta’ parameterization that some
statisticians are familiar with and will find natural to use.

### Enter a license key

If a new license key is required, this command can be used to enter one.
There are two ways of entering a new license:

The key can be entered directly, along with the associated Organization
name (and for limited licenses the name of the system FACTS is installed
on), or by selecting a supplied license file.

## The Help Menu

FACTS has a Help menu with commands to assist you with the use of FACTS,
providing links to users guides, tutorial and training videos. The
commands are:

User Guides Provides access to documents such as this one, with (mainly)
one user guide to each design type within FACTS. Exceptions to this
simple structure are:

- Core Design User Guide: A guide to the options under the ‘Design” tab
  for FACTS Core for all endpoints.

- Staged Design User Guide: As the staged design allows the design of
  one FACTS Core stage followed by a second, most of the interface is
  common to the basic FACTS Core. This guide describes the differences
  and additional aspects for all endpoints.

- Dose Escalation User Guide: This covers all the Dose Escalation
  engines except for N-CRM and 2D-CRM that have their own. It thus
  covers the 3+3, mTPI, CRM(Toxicity), CRM(Ordinal), CRM(Efficacy) and
  bCRM engines.

Tutorials Provides access to all the tutorial documents, which describes
detailed examples of use of all the engines in FACTS and many of their
options. The examples under the File \> Examples menu option largely
correspond to the different tutorials described here.

Design Specifications These are technical documents that describe the
mathematical models implemented in FACTS in detail.

Execution Guides The FACTS GUI can be run in command line mode so
simulations can be run/re-run from scripts. With the simulation command
line flag, and passed a directory rather than a file, FACTS will run
simulations for every “.facts” file in that directory – and recurse into
any sub-directories and simulate any “.facts” files there too. A full
guide to command line mode can be found here. The FACTS simulation
engines are also available in “command line executable” form. There are
guides here that document their command line parameters and how to use
them to analyse a data set – e.g. to perform an interim analysis whilst
executing a trial designed with FACTS.

FACTS file XML Specs These guides describe the parameters in the
“.facts” files, which are text files in XML format. For expert users
understanding this format allows them to use scripts to generate
versions of an initial “.facts” file with slight variations in the
parameters such as stopping thresholds or priors. Modification of
“.facts” files outside of FACTS needs to be done with care, errors may

# The Study Tabs

## Study Info

On the Study Info tab the user can

- Specify the maximum trial size (in subjects not cohorts, as subjects
  tested in the run-on phase count to the overall total).

- Specify the parameters of the target, the user specifies the
  boundaries between the different toxicity bands, and whether using
  overdose limits and if so which ones and what the overdosing
  thresholds are.

<figcaption><p>Figure 7‑1 Study info tab: 2D-CRM</p></figcaption>
</figure>

## Treatment Arms

On the Treatment Arms tab the user specifies the names of the drugs, and
the number, relative strength and names of the doses of each drug. The
user can either click the ‘Add’ button the required number of times or
use Auto generate doses, specifying the number of doses to create and
initial dose level. Auto generate deletes all the pre-existing doses
before generating the new ones.

After creating the desired number of entries the user can edit the
strengths and names of the doses.

It is up to the user to ensure that the dose strengths are in
monotonically increasing order.

It is now (FACTS 6.4.1 and later) possible to enter dose strengths of 0,
to create dose combinations that are monotherapies. This is particularly
useful for enabling prior information from monotherapy trials to be
included in this design.

style="width:6.00046in;height:4.26954in" />
<figcaption><p>Figure 7‑2 Treatment Arms tab</p></figcaption>
</figure>

## Exclude

On the Study \> Exclude tab the user can specify dose combinations that
cannot be used in the trial. By clicking on any square on the grid the
corresponding dose combination is cycled through the following states:
‘Toxic’, ‘Not Available’, ‘Ineffective’ and ‘Available’. The initial
state is ‘Available’ for all combinations.

If a combination is specified as ‘Toxic’ then all the combinations where
both drugs are at the same or higher strength are also excluded.

If a combination is specified as ‘Ineffective’ then all combinations
where both drugs are at the same or lower strength are also excluded.

If a combination is specified as ‘Not Available’ then just that
combination is excluded with no consequences for the combinations around
it.

If there are any combinations where, after transformation of the dose
strengths, both drugs have a dose strength of less than 0.001 this must
be excluded from the trial (mark them “ineffective” or “not available”).
Any toxicities occurring on such a combination would be data that the
model would have difficulty fitting.

</figure>

# The Virtual Subject Response Tabs

The Virtual Subject Response tabs are used to define the toxicity rates
to use in simulating subjects responses. In each scenario a specific
toxicity rate is specified for each dose combination. Thus a range of
different scenarios is usually created that span the range of toxicities
that are believed credible. As well as the absolute toxicities the
scenarios should span the different rates at which its thought that the
toxicity rates could change from dose to dose, and also span the
different degrees of drug-drug interaction – both +ve and –ve that are
believed credible.

There are two ways of specifying scenarios: Explicitly entering the rate
to simulate for each combination, and Parametrically entering the
parameters of a simple model from which the toxicity at every
combination then derived.

## Explicitly Defined

On the VSR \> Explicitly Defined tab, the user enters the toxicity rate
to use when simulating subject responses, for every dose combination.
The cells are colored according to the toxicity band coloring convention
used in FACTS (under-dosing: blue, target: green, excess: orange,
unacceptable: red) according to the toxicity rate entered.

<figure>
<img src="./2DCRM/media/image16.png"
style="width:4.99542in;height:3.79196in" />
<figcaption><p>Figure 8‑1 VSR Explicitly Defined tab</p></figcaption>
</figure>

### Parametric

On the VSR \> Parametric tab, the user enters the parameters for a model
that generates a toxicity rate to use when simulating subject responses,
for every dose combination. The cells are colored using toxic band
coloring according to the toxicity rate of that dose combination.

The model used is the 5 parameter BLRM model that is used as the
Toxicity response model on the Design \> Response Model tab, but the
user can specify different ‘effective dose strength’ models from those
used in the analysis.

<figure>
<img src="./2DCRM/media/image17.png"
style="width:6.04544in;height:4.59046in"
alt="Graphical user interface, chart, table, treemap chart Description automatically generated" />
<figcaption><p>Figure 8‑2 VSR &gt; Parametric tab</p></figcaption>
</figure>

For each profile the user specifies:

- For each drug the ‘effective dose strength’ model.

  - The reference dose (where the effective dose strength is 1 and the
    toxicity rate due to that drug is given by the Alpha parameter
    alone).

  - Whether the effective dose strength is the ratio of dose strength to
    the reference dose or the exponential of the difference of the to
    dose strength from the reference dose.

- For each drug the values of the coefficients of the single drug models
  entered as ln(alpha) and ln(Beta)

- The value of Eta, the drug-drug interaction term – Eta is the log-odds
  ratio between the interaction and the non-interaction model at the
  reference dose combination.

It is perfectly reasonable to use the parametric models by simply
varying the parameters using trial and error until the desired set of
toxicity rates is achieved.

# The Design Tabs

The Design tab allows the user to specify:

- Start-up: where the parameters of the run-in phase (if any) are
  specified.

- Dose Escalation: where the ad hoc rules for limiting dose escalation
  and early stopping are specified.

- Response Model: where the priors for the dose-toxicity model are
  specified.

- Prior Toxicities: where any prior observations are specified.

## Start-up

The Start-up tab allows the user to specify what is commonly referred to
as a single patient run-in, in the FACTS 2D-CRM it’s allowed to be a
‘small cohort run in. (The paper [@ivanova2003improved] showed that smaller target
toxicity rates benefited from larger cohort sizes in the run in).

On this tab the user can specify

- The scheme to used for the run-in: “None”, “Contour”, “Row by Row”,
  “Tri-axial” or “Custom”. These are described above (2.3.1) and in
  \[Spec\].

  - If “None” is specified then the table for specifying specific dose
    combinations is used to specify the dose combination(s) to be
    assigned to the starting cohort(s). These will be the full sized
    cohorts used in the escalation phase.

- The cohort size to use in the run-in. A size of ‘1’ yields a ‘single
  patient run in’, but other values are possible and may give better
  results, (see [@ivanova2003improved]).

- For the ‘Row by row’ run-in scheme, the number of drug 1 dose
  increments to back-off each time drug 2 is incremented.

- The range of the run-in. If the user does not want the run-in to
  possibly run all the way up to the maximum dose strengths, even if no
  toxicities have been observed, it is possible to specify a rectangular
  area of dose combinations for the run-in to include by specifying the
  starting combination (the lower left corner of the rectangle) and the
  stopping dose (the upper right corner combination). Note that as you
  would expect, regardless of whether this feature is used or not, dose
  combinations that have been excluded from the study on the Stud \>
  Exclude tab are excluded from the Run-in.

- The dose allocation scheme: (only applies to the Contour and Tri-axial
  Run-in schemes):

  - allocate a single cohort;

  - allocate the cohort across the next possible dose combinations;

  - or allocate a cohort to each of the next dose combinations and
    optionally specify a maximum number of cohorts / dose combinations
    that can be tested at a single step.

> The Row by row and Custom run-ins only identify one dose combination
> to test next, and so use “single cohort” allocation regardless of the
> setting of this control.

- Where to allocate after the end of the run-in it it ends due to
  observing toxicities, either:

  - expand the allocation at the combinations where toxicity has been
    observed,

  - or at one dose increment below where toxicity has been observed.

> If the run-in ends because it has reached the end of the combinations
> to be tested during Run-in without seeing a toxicity, then dose
> escalation starts by expanding at the allocation of the maximum dose
> combination(s).

- If use of a Custom run-in has been specified, then the sequence of
  dose combinations is specified.

style="width:5.99542in;height:4.26472in" />
<figcaption><p>Figure 9‑1 Design &gt; Start-up tab</p></figcaption>
</figure>

## Dose Escalation

The Dose Escalation tab allows the user to specify the dose escalation
and early stopping rules to use during the Dose Escalation phase.

On this tab the user can specify:

- The cohort size.

- The minimum number of subjects: that must be have been tested at a
  combination before the trial can escalate to a higher dose combination
  (that is not excluded by the overdose control).

- The maximum dose increment: in either drug that can be applied from a
  combination that has been tested, and where the minimum of subjects
  have been tested, to a higher dose combination.

- The dose escalation scheme: “Contour”, “Walk”, “Tri-Axial” or
  “Allocate to MTT”. These are described in (2.3.2) and in \[Spec\].

- The dose allocation scheme: (only applies to the “Contour” and
  “Tri-axial” schemes):

  - allocate a single cohort;

  - allocate the cohort across the next possible doses;

  - or allocate a cohort to each of the next doses.

> The “Walk” and “Allocate to MTT” escalation schemes only identify one
> next combination, and so use “single cohort” allocation regardless of
> the setting of this control.
>
> If “Multiple simultaneous cohorts” is specified, then it is possible
> to set a limit on the maximum number of cohorts / dose combinations
> tested in the next step.

- Maximum subjects on MTT. This is the maximum number of subjects to
  allocate to a combination under Dose Escalation. In the “Contour”,
  “Walk”, “Tri-Axial” escalation schemes this is currently the only
  stopping rule. If all the targeted combinations have the maximum
  number of subjects on them, the trial stops.

<figure>
<img src="./2DCRM/media/image19.png"
style="width:5.99542in;height:4.26472in" />
<figcaption><p>Figure 9‑2n Design &gt; Dose Escalation
tab</p></figcaption>
</figure>

All the escalation schemes stop if the maximum number of subjects has
been allocated or all combinations are too toxic (the posterior
probabilities of toxicity exceed the overdose threshold). The schemes
other than “Allocate to MTT” can also stop when the maximum number of
subjects on MTT is reached on all the target doses.

If the “Allocate to MTT” escalation scheme, is being used then
additional stopping rules similar to those available in N-CRM can be
enabled. If they are enabled, then the following may be specified:

- Minimum subjects on MTT: the trial can only stop with a combination
  selection if the combination to be allocated to have at least these
  number of subjects on them.

- Stop when Posterior Probability of target Toxicity @MTT is at least:
  the trial can stop with a combination selection when the combination
  to be allocated to has a posterior probability that its toxicity rate
  is in the Target Toxicity band is at least the specified amount.

- Minimum cohort’s accrued: the trial can only stop with a combination
  selection if the specified minimum number of cohorts has been
  allocated and completed.

- Minimum toxicities: the trial can only stop for all combinations too
  toxic if the required minimum number of toxicities have been observed.
  Whilst all combinations are too toxic but this minimum number of
  toxicities havs not been observed, subjects are allocated to the
  lowest dose combination.

## Response Model

The Response Model tab displays a description of the model and 4 other
components:

- A panel where the prior distributions for the model parameters can be
  input. Unless prior toxicity information is also to be included, it is
  recommended that uninformative priors are not used as these tend to
  lead to a failure to re-escalate to a dose if just one toxicity has
  been observed there, due to overdose control.

> Values that represent weakly informative priors are recommended
> instead. The prior mean and SD for each Alpha should represent the
> prior expectation (in log-odds) of toxicity at the reference dose for
> that drug in isolation. Having set Alpha the prior for Beta should be
> set to allow gradients that are as steep as plausible, but if set too
> high, or too broad it may cause problems of not being able to escalate
> to high doses because of overdose control (even with few toxicities at
> low doses the uncertainty of the model at higher doses where there is
> currently no data may mean the posterior estimates of toxicity at
> these doses exceed the overdose control thresholds). This can be
> checked looking at example simulations or manually by entering test
> data on the Analysis tab. The prior for the correlation should usually
> be zero or slightly negative. A positive prior for Rho means that if
> the value for Alpha is estimated as low (due to low toxicity being
> observed near the reference dose) then the value of Beta will be
> estimated as being low – and this may lead to too low an estimate of
> toxicity at higher doses. A very strongly negative prior for Rho can
> lead to the same problems as a too high or broad prior for Beta.

- A panel where the transformations of the virtual dose strengths to
  values that can be used by the model is specified. This transformation
  is usually the dose ratio of each dose to the median dose of that
  drug. Options to use a linear transform and a different reference dose
  are available.

> The recommended values for the reference dose are either the center of
> the dose range (the default “Median dose”) or the dose thought most
> likely to be in the middle of the target toxicity range for that drug
> alone.

- Re-scaling the response model. The model estimates rates between 0 and
  1 and works best when the observed rates are asymptotically 0 or 1. If
  the observed toxicity is known to have different minimum and maximum
  rates (0.1 and 0.5 say) then the model fits is much, much better if
  these are specified as the asymptotes in place of 0 and 1.

> **If a dose combination of 0,0 is included in the design (even when
> excluded from be used in the trial, as it must be) the response model
> must be re-scaled with a minimum asymptote above 0, even if only very
> slightly (such as 0.0001).**

- The last panel displays the values of the model at the dose
  combinations using the specified parameters.

<figcaption><p>Figure 9‑3 Design &gt; Response Model
tab</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Specifying the Priors: The priors for each pair of parameters (α,β) for
the response model for each drug are specified via a bivariate normal
distribution (as in the single drug N-CRM), with a separate mean and SD
for α and β, and a correlation term ρ (Rho). The prior for the
interaction term η (Eta) is the mean and Sd of a Normal distribution.

Specifying the dose transform: For both drugs the transformation of the
dose strengths to a range of values suited to the model is specified.
For each drug the transformations are relative to ‘reference’ dose, by
default the median value in the dose range. The transformation can be
linear log(d – d<sup>\*</sup>) or the dose ratio ((d/d<sup>\*</sup>))

Specifying the asymptotes: The model fits values in the range (0-1),
asymptotically approaching either limit. If desired the range can be
reduced by re-scaling so that it asymptotically approaches a specified
lower limit \> 0 and upper limit \< 1.

Checking the prior: The influence of the prior on the model can be
checked by viewing the results of sampling of the model parameters from
the specified prior. Options are to view a) 100 samples of the
1-dimensional model for drug 1 or drug 2, or b) 1,000 samples of the
2-dimensional model over both drugs showing the 10%-ile, median or
90%-ile toxicities at each dose combination.

<figcaption><p>Figure 9‑4 Design &gt; Response Model showing individual
drug prior</p></figcaption>
</figure>

The individual drug graph plots the doses at the log of their
transformed dose strength (“Log(X^)”), this enables the logits to be
plotted linearly.

If there is a transformed dose strength of 0, this is plotted at some
notional value that represents -infinity, and to see the plot at the
other doses the “Plot excl. first dose” option should be checked.

## Prior Toxicities

This tab allows prior information to be included with the data collected
during the trial.

The user can specify, for any dose combinations a prior observed number
of toxicities and number of observations. To allow the prior data to be
down weighted, the user is allowed to enter fractional amounts.

The specified prior data is simply added to the observed data when
fitting the model, but this is logically equivalent to fitting the model
with the specified prior to the specified prior data and then using the
resulting posterior estimate of the model parameters as the prior for
fitting the model to the observed data.

Some idea of the effect of the prior data can be gained by using the
“Analysis” tab, and performing an analysis on a dataset without any
additional subject data.

If there is a combination where the transformed dose strengths of both
drugs are below 0.001, there can be no prior observed toxicities for
that combination (it would be impossible for the model to fit them).

# Simulation Tab

The Simulation tab allows the user to execute simulations for each of
the scenarios specified for the study. The user may choose the number of
simulations, whether to execute locally or on the Grid, and modify the
random number seeds.

If completed results are available, the *actual* number of simulations
run for each scenario is reported in one of the first columns of the
results table. The value displayed in the “Number of Simulations”
control is the number of simulations that *will be* run if the user
clicks on the ‘Simulate’ button.

<figure>

style="width:4.99542in;height:3.55339in" />
<figcaption><p>Figure 11‑1 Simulation tab</p></figcaption>
</figure>

N.B. FACTS uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in the generation of
simulated patient response data and trial results. In order to exactly
reproduce a statistical set of results, it is necessary to start the
Markov Chain from an identical “Random Seed”. The initial random seed
for FACTS simulations is set from the simulation tab, the first thing
that FACTS does is to draw the random number seeds to use at the start
of each simulation. It is possible to re-run a specific simulation, for
example to have more detailed output files generated, by specifying
‘start at simulation’.

Say the 999<sup>th</sup> simulation out of a set displayed some unusual
behavior, in order to understand why, one might want to see the
individual interim analyses for that simulation (the “weeks” file), the
sampled subject results for that simulation (the “Subjects” files) and
possibly even the MCMC samples from the analyses in that simulation. You
can save the .facts file with a slightly different name (to preserve the
existing simulation results), then run 1 simulation of the specific
scenario, specifying that the simulations start at simulation 999 and
that at least 1 weeks file, 1 subjects file and the MCMC samples file
(see the “MCMC settings” dialog) are output.

Even a small change in the random seed will produce different simulation
results.

The same random number seed is used at the start of the simulation of
each scenario. If two identical scenarios are specified then identical
simulation results will be obtained. The same may happen if scenarios or
designs only differ in ways that have no impact on the trials being
simulated, for instance designs that have no adaptation, or scenarios
that don’t trigger any adaptation (e.g. none of the simulations stop
early).

The user can specify:

- the number of simulations for which ‘Cohorts’ files are written.
  ‘Cohorts’ files record the data, analysis and recommendation at each
  interim (after each cohort).

- The parallelization packet size, this allows simulation jobs to be
  split into runs of no-more than the specified number of trials to
  simulate. If more simulations of a scenario are requested than can be
  done in one packet, the simulations are started as the requisite
  number of packets and the results combined and summarized when they
  are all complete – so the final results files look just as though all
  the simulations were run as one job or packet. When running
  simulations on the local machine FACTS enterprise version will process
  as many packets in parallel as there are execution threads on the
  local machine. The overhead of packetization is quite low so a packet
  size of 10 to 100 can help speed up the overall simulation process –
  threads used to simulate scenarios that finish quicker can pick up
  packets for scenarios that take longer, if the number of scenarios is
  no directly divisible by the number of threads packetization uses all
  threads until the last few packets have to be run and finally the
  “Simulations complete” figure can be updated at the end of each
  packet, so the small the packet the better FACTS can report the
  overall progress.

## To run simulations

Even before simulations have been run, FACTS displays a row for each
possible combination of the ‘profiles’ that have been specified: -
baseline response, dose response, longitudinal response, accrual rate
and dropout rate. Each such combination is a ‘simulation scenario’.

The user clicks on the check box for each scenario to be simulated, or
simply clicks on “Select All”, then clicks on the “Simulate” button.

During simulation, the user is prevented from modifying any parameters
on any other tab of the application. This safeguard ensures that the
simulation results reflect the parameters specified in the user
interface.

When simulations are started, FACTS saves all the study parameters into
the current “.facts” file, and when the simulations are complete all the
simulation results are saved in a “\_results” folder in the same
directory as the “.facts” file. Within the “\_results” folder there are
sub-folders that holds the results for each scenario.

## MCMC Settings

The first two values specify two standard MCMC parameters –

- The length of burn-in is the number of the initial iterations whose
  results are discarded, to allow the sampled values to settle down.

- The number of samples is the number of subsequent iterations whose
  results are recorded in order to give posterior estimates of the
  values of interest (in this case α and β).

**Number of samples per imputation** (not used in 2D-CRM, the model does
not include imputation)

If the **Number of MCMC samples to output** value is set to N, where N
\> 0, then all the sampled values at each interim in the first N
simulations are output in a file per simulation, allowing the user to
check convergence.

**The MCMC output thinning parameter** can be used to reduce the amount
of data output to the MCMC file. It does not reduce the amount of MCMC
samples used within the model fitting.

To obtain the MCMC sampled values for a particular simulation, keep the
same Random number seed and use **Start at simulation** to specify the
simulation in question and run just 1 simulation.

Figure 11‑2 Simulations tab: MCMC Settings

## How many simulations to run?

- After first entering a design it is worth running just a small number
  of simulations such as 10 to check that the scenarios and design have
  been entered correctly. If all 10 simulations of a ‘null’ scenario are
  successful, or all 10 simulations of what was intended to be an
  effective drug scenario are futile, it is likely there has been a
  mistake or misunderstanding in the specification of the scenarios or
  the final evaluation or early stopping criteria.

- Once the design and scenarios look broadly correct, it is usually
  worth quickly collecting rough estimates of the operating
  characteristics using around 100 simulations for each scenario. 100
  simulations is enough to spot designs having very poor operating
  characteristics such as very high type-1 error, very poor power, a
  strong tendency to stop early for the wrong reason, or poor
  probability of selecting the correct target. 100 simulations is also
  usually sufficient to spot problems with the data analysis such as
  poor model fits and significant bias in the posterior estimates.

- Typically 1,000 simulations of each scenario of interest is required
  to get estimates of the operating characteristics precise enough to
  compare designs and tune the parameters. (Very roughly rates of 5%
  (such as type-1 error) can be estimated to about +/-1.5% and rates of
  around 80% (such as power) estimated +/- 2.5%)

- Finally around 10,000 simulations of the scenarios of interest is
  required to give confidence in operating characteristics of a design
  and possibly to select between the final shortlisted designs
  (Approximately rates of 5% can be estimated to about +/-0.5% and rates
  of around 80% estimated +/- 1%).

There may be many operating characteristics need to be compared over a
number of scenarios, such as expected sample size, type-1 error, power,
probability of selecting a good dose as the target and quality of
estimation of the dose-response.

However frequently these will be compared over a range of scenarios, it
may not be necessary to run very large number of simulations for each
scenario if a design shows a consistent advantage on the key operating
characteristics over the majority of the scenarios.

## Simulation results

In the main screen the summary results that are usually of principal
interest are displayed, the results summarised by scenario.

- **Show other columns**: Allows the user to open additional windows on
  the simulation results, the windows available are:

  - **All**: A window containing all the summary results columns

  - **Highlights**: a separate window with the results shown on the main
    tab

  - **Allocation, Observed**: summary results of the number of subjects
    allocated, the number allocated to each dose, the number of
    toxicities observed and the number of toxicities observed per dose

  - **Fitted toxicity**: summary results of the estimates of the model
    parameters and the dose-toxicity.

  - **Pr(MTD) etc**: summary results of the posterior probabilities of
    the properties of interest

  - **Simulation Results**: a window displaying the individual
    simulation results for each simulation of the currently selected
    scenario

- **View Graph**: opens the FACTS built in graph utility displaying the
  results for the currently selected scenario. See **Error! Reference
  source not found.** below for a description of the graphs.

- **Aggregate**: opens a control that allows the user create aggregated
  results files from all the scenarios. The user can select which
  scenarios to include, and whether the results should be pivoted by
  dose. The resulting files are stored in the simulation results folder.

- **Open in R**: If aggregated files have been created then clicking
  this button on the simulations tab will open control that allows the
  user to select which aggregations to load into data frames as R is
  opened. Otherwise it will offer to open R using the files in the
  currently selected scenario.

- *Right Click Menu:* right clicking the mouse on a row of results in
  the simulation tab brings up a ‘local’ menu of options:

  - **Open results folder**: Opens a file browser in the results folder
    of the scenario, allowing swift access to any of the results files.

  - **Simulation results**: Opens a window displaying the individual
    simulation results for each simulation of the currently selected
    scenario

  - **Open in R**: opens a control that will launch R, first loading the
    selected files in the results folder as data frames.

  - **Show Graphs**: launches the graph viewer to view the results of
    the currently selected scenario.

## FACTS Grid Simulation Settings

If you have access to a computational grid, you may choose to have your
simulations run on the grid instead of running them locally. This frees
your computer from the computationally intensive task of simulating so
you can continue other work or even shutdown your PC or laptop. In order
to run simulations on the grid, it must first be configured, this is
normally done via a configuration file supplied with the FACTS
installation by the IT group responsible for the FACTS installation.

## Detailed Simulation Results

After simulation has completed and simulation results have been loaded,
the user may examine detailed results for any scenario with simulation
data in the table by double-clicking on the row. A separate window (as
in Figure 11‑4) shows the results simulation by simulation. Like the
summary results – the initial window hold “highlights”, right clicking
on the window displays a menu with options for viewing the “Fitted
Toxicity”, “Observed Toxicity” or “All” Columns.

## Cohort Simulation Results

After viewing individual simulation results, the user may examine
detailed results for any simulation with per-cohort data in the table by
right-clicking on the row and selecting “Cohort Results”. A separate
window opens, showing the result for the selected simulation cohort by
cohort. Like the summary and simulation results the initial window
displays “highlights” columns, right clicking on the window displays a
menu with options for viewing the “Fitted Toxicity”, “Observed Toxicity”
or “All” Columns.

## Aggregation

Aggregation combines the csv output from multiple scenarios into fewer
csv files. The Aggregate… button displays a dialog which allows the user
to select what to aggregate.

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image27.png"
style="width:5.07835in;height:4.2394in" />

The default location for the aggregated files is the results directory
for the study, but this can be changed.

In other design engines there is the option to pivot the results by
dose, this is more complicated in 2D-CRM and the option is not
available.

The default is to aggregate all scenarios, but any combination may be
selected.

Pressing “Aggregate” generates the aggregated files.

Each type of csv file is aggregated into a separate csv file whose name
begins agg\_, so agg_summary.csv will contain the rows from each of the
summary.csv files, cohortsNNN.csv files are aggregated into a single
agg_cohorts.csv file. Doses.csv is identical for all scenarios and so is
not aggregated.

Each aggregated file begins with the following extra columns, followed
by the columns from the original csv file:

| Column Name | Comments |
|----|----|
| Scenario ID | Index of the scenario |
| Toxicity Profile | A series of columns containing the names of the various profiles used to construct the scenario. Columns that are never used are omitted (e.g External Subjects Profile if there are no external scenarios) |
| External Subjects Profile |  |
| Agg Timestamp | Date and time when aggregation was performed |
| Sim | Simulation number. Only present in the cohorts file. |
| Dose | Only present if pivoted |

# The Summary Results Columns

The simulation results are grouped into 4 tables; these tables can be
opened by clicking the “Show Other Columns” button.

- Highlights: these are the columns displayed in table on the Simulation
  tab.

- Fitted Toxicity

- Observed Toxicity

- All – the combination of all the above.

The columns displayed in the first three tables are described in the
subsections below.

Right clicking on any summary results table brings up a menu that allows
the user to:

- Open the results folder for the scenario line that the cursor is on

- Open a window with the per simulation results

- Open R and load the results as data frames

- Open the FACTS graph display widow for the currently selected
  scenario.

## Highlights

These are the columns displayed on the simulations tab after simulations
are completed, the can also be displayed in the separate “Highlights”
results window.

These results are in the ‘summar.csv’ files in each scenario results
folder.

|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| **Column Title** | **Number of columns** | **Description** |

## The Per-Simulation Results

Double clicking on any row in the simulation results table, opens a
window displaying the individual simulation results. This table shows
the individual results that are averaged in the summary table.

These values are in the ‘simulations.csv’ for each scenario in the
scenario results folder.

Like the summary results, the per-simulation results are organized into
‘Highlights’, ‘Fitted Toxicity’ and ‘Observed Toxicity’ tables, with the
corresponding columns.

Right clicking on any summary results table brings up a menu that allows
the user to:

- Open the per-simulations results window with all columns

- Open the per-simulations results window with the highlights columns

- Open the per-simulations results window with the fitted toxicity
  columns

- Open the per-simulations results window with the observed toxicity
  columns

- Open the results folder for the scenario line that the cursor is on

- Open the cohort results widow for the currently selected simulation.

# Graphs

There are 7 “overall” graphs that show means over the simulations and 5
graphs that show results per simulation or per cohort per simulation and
one graph that shows the “true” toxicity – that is the toxicity rates
being simulated for each dose combination in the scenario. The per
cohort graphs can only be displayed for those simulations with “full
results” (the number of these is specified on the “Advanced” dialog
window on the Simulations tab), that is a “cohortsNNNN.csv” file has
been written out for that simulation (where “NNNN” is replaced by the
simulation number).

The 7 Overall graphs are:

1.  Fitted Ppn(Toxicity) – Displays the mean of the fitted mean toxicity
    rates at each dose combination, the cells are colored according to
    the fitted rate, also shows the mean observed number of toxicities
    and mean number of subjects exposed at each dose combination.

2.  Ppn Toxicity Bands – Displays the mean of the posterior
    probabilities that the toxicity rate lies in the selected toxicity
    band at each dose combination, also shows the mean observed number
    of toxicities and mean number of subjects exposed at each dose
    combination.

3.  Toxicity Summary Graph – Displays a small histogram for each dose
    combination, plotting the mean probability that the toxicity rate
    lies in each of the toxicity bands, also highlights those dose
    combinations that would be exclude based on applying the overdose
    control rules to the mean probabilities.

4.  Mean Pr(Selected MTT) – Displays the ppn of times each dose
    combination was selected as MTT (Maximum probability of being in the
    Target Toxicity band) (depending on the Dose Escalation method
    employed, there may be more than one combination selected as MTT at
    the end of each simulation).

5.  Mean Subject Allocation – Displays the mean number of subjects
    allocated to each dose combination.

6.  Mean Observed Toxicity – Displays the mean of the fitted mean
    toxicity rates at each dose combination, also shows the mean
    observed number of toxicities and mean number of subjects exposed at
    each dose combination. The cells are colored according to the
    observed toxicity ratio.

7.  Study Sizes and Outcomes – Displays a histogram of the Ppn of
    simulations that completed at different sample sizes, colored to
    indicate their reason for stopping.

The 5 per-simulation and per-cohort graphs are

1.  Fitted Pr(Toxicity) – Displays fitted mean toxicity rate at each
    dose combination, the cells are colored according to the fitted
    rate, also shows the observed number of toxicities and the number of
    subjects exposed at each dose combination.

2.  Pr(Toxicity Band) - Displays the posterior probability that the
    toxicity rate lies in the selected toxicity band at each dose
    combination, also shows the observed number of toxicities and number
    of subjects exposed at each dose combination.

3.  Summary graph - Displays a small histogram for each dose
    combination, plotting the probability that the toxicity rate lies in
    each of the toxicity bands, also highlights those dose combinations
    that are excluded based on applying the overdose control rules to
    the probabilities.

4.  Subject Allocation - Displays the number of subjects allocated to
    each dose combination.

5.  Observed Pr(Toxicity) - Displays the fitted mean toxicity rate at
    each dose combination, also shows the observed number of toxicities
    and the number of subjects exposed at each dose combination. The
    cells are colored according to the observed toxicity ratio. The dose
    combinations selected as MTT / next combinations to allocate to are
    indicated.

## Fitted Ppn(Toxicity)

The Fitted Ppn(Toxicity) graph shows the average mean posterior estimate
of the toxicity at each combination, with the cells colored in
increasing intensity the higher the fitted toxicity. In addition in each
cell the average number of observed toxicities and average total
observations is reported.

The format is:

Fit: \<Average Mean estimate of toxicity\>

Obs: \<Mean toxicity observations\> / \<Mean total observations\>

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image30.png"
style="width:4.72734in;height:2.77636in" />

## Ppn(Toxicity Bands)

The Ppn(Toxicity Bands) graph shows the average mean posterior estimate
that the toxicity falls in one of the defined toxicity bands, with the
cells colored from faint to intense the higher the probability. The
color used depends on the band being displayed: blue for under-dosing,
green for target, orange for excess and red for unacceptable.

In addition in each cell the average number of observed toxicities and
average total observations is reported.

The format is:

Prob: \<Average Posterior Probability\>

Obs: \<Mean toxicity observations\> / \<Mean total observations\>

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image31.png"
style="width:4.99542in;height:2.9338in" />

## Toxicity Summary Graph

The Toxicity Summary Graph displays a small histogram for each dose
combination. In each histogram it shows for that dose combination the
posterior probability its toxicity rate is in each of the four toxicity
bands.

If the posterior probabilities are such that the dose combination is
excluded by the overdose control rules, then the background of the
histogram is in pink to highlight it.

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image32.png"
style="width:5.15513in;height:3.0276in" />

## Mean Pr(Selected MTT)

The Mean Pr(Selected MTT) graph shows the average number of times each
combination was selected as the, or one of the, combinations with
Maximum Target Toxicity. The cells are colored more intensely the
greater the Ppn of simulations that the dose combination was selected as
MTT.

The ‘Selected as MTT’ dose combination is the one with the maximum
posterior probability of having a toxicity rate in the target band and
not excluded by overdose control. The ‘Walk’ and ‘Allocate to MTT’ dose
escalation methods select a single MTT at the end of a trial, but the
‘Contour’ and ‘Tri-Axial’ can select multiple MTTs so when using these
dose escalation methods these probabilities can sum to more than 1.

The format is:

\<PPn of simulations this combination selected as MTT\>

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image33.png"
style="width:4.99542in;height:2.9338in" />

## Mean Subject Allocation

The Mean Subject Allocation graph shows the average number of subjects
allocated to each combination over all the simulations, with the cells
colored from white to dark blue the greater the number allocated.

The format is:

\<Number of subjects allocated to this combination\>

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image34.png"
style="width:4.99542in;height:2.9338in" />

## Mean Observed Pr(Toxicity)

The Mean Observed Pr(Toxicity) graph shows the average number of
observations and number of toxicities along with the mean fitted
toxicity across all the simulations. The color intensity reflects the
fraction of observations that resulted in toxicity, with the color more
intense the closer that fraction gets to 1..

The format is:

Fit: \<Average Mean Estimate of Toxicity\>

Obs: \<Mean toxicity observations\> / \<Mean total observations\>

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image35.png"
style="width:4.99542in;height:2.9338in" />

## Study Sizes and Outcomes

The Study Sizes and Outcomes graph plots a histogram, of the sample
sizes of the simulations. The bars are colored to show why the simulated
trial stopped:

- Because all dose combinations were too toxic (barred by the overdose
  control rules)

- Because defined stopping rule had been met.

- Because the trial maximum sample size had been reached.

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image36.png"
style="width:5.99542in;height:3.5211in" />

## Fitted Pr(Toxicity) per simulation/per cohort

The Fitted Ppn(Toxicity) graph shows the mean posterior estimate of the
toxicity at each combination for each simulation, with the cells colored
from beige to intense red the higher the toxicity. In addition in each
cell the number of observed toxicities and total observations is
reported.

For simulations for which a “cohortNNNN.csv” file was output, the graph
can be viewed for the result of the analysis after each cohort –
allowing the trial to be “stepped through” a cohort at a time.

The format is:

Fit: \<Mean estimate of toxicity\>

Obs: \< Toxicity observations\> / \<Total observations\>

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image37.png"
style="width:5.05792in;height:2.97051in" />

## Pr(Toxicity Band) per simulation/per cohort

The Ppn(Toxicity Bands) graph shows the posterior estimate that the
toxicity falls in one of the defined toxicity bands for each simulation,
with the cells colored from faint to intense the higher the probability.
The color used depends on the band being displayed: blue for
under-dosing, green for target, orange for excess and red for
unacceptable.

In addition in each cell the number of observed toxicities and total
observations is reported.

For simulations for which a “cohortNNNN.csv” file was output, the graph
can also be viewed for the result of the analysis after each cohort –
allowing the trial to be “stepped through” a cohort at a time.

The format is:

Prob: \<The Posterior Probability\>

Obs: \<The number toxicity observations\> / \<The number of total
observations\>

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image38.png"
style="width:4.99542in;height:2.9338in" />

## Summary Graph per simulation/per cohort

The Summary graph shows the posterior estimate that the toxicity falls
into each of the defined toxicity bands as a small histogram for each
dose combination

In addition in the cells where the dose combination is excluded by the
overdose rules are highlighted with a pink background.

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image39.png"
style="width:4.99542in;height:2.9338in" />

## Subject Allocation per simulation/per cohort

The Subject Allocation graph shows the number of subjects allocated to
each combination in a particular simulation with the cells colored from
white to dark blue the greater the number allocated.

For simulations for which a “cohortNNNN.csv” file was output, the graph
can also be viewed for the subject allocation after each cohort –
allowing the trial to be “stepped through” a cohort at a time.

The format is:

\<Number of subjects allocated to this combination\>

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image40.png"
style="width:4.99542in;height:2.9338in" />

## Observed Pr(Toxicity) per simulation/per cohort

The Observed Pr(Toxicity) graph shows the number of observations and
number of toxicities for each combination, for each the simulation. The
color intensity reflects the fraction of observations that resulted in
toxicity, with the color more intense the closer that fraction gets to
1.The size of the colored square is proportional to the number of
observations.

For simulations for which a “cohortNNNN.csv” file was output, the graph
can also be viewed for the subject allocation after each cohort –
allowing the trial to be “stepped through” a cohort at a time.

The format is:

- Obs: \<Mean toxicity observations\> / \<Mean total observations\>

- \[X\] signifies the combination that is (one of) the combination(s)
  selected for allocation to for the next cohort. At the end of the
  simulation, these are the combinations that are selected as the MTT.

- Cells excluded by the overdose control rules are marked with a “\*”.

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image41.png"
style="width:4.99542in;height:2.9338in" />

## True Pr(Toxicity)

The True Ppn(Toxicity) graph shows the toxicity rate simulated at each
combination for all the simulations, with the cells colored from beige
to intense red the higher the toxicity.

The format is:

\<Simulated toxicity rate\>

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image42.png"
style="width:5.05792in;height:3.22527in" />

# Analysis Tab

Initially the Analysis tab just displays a “Use Design to Analyze Data”
button.

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image43.png"
style="width:4.87042in;height:2.64579in" />

After clicking the button the tab becomes active,

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image44.png"
style="width:4.98629in;height:3.78503in" />

and an “Analysis” folder is created alongside the folder that hold the
simulation results.

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image45.png"
style="width:5.05792in;height:2.92026in" />

In the “…\_Results” folder there an empty “subject.csv file will have
been created

This is the file that should be edited to contain the data to be
analyzed, or the data can be added via the FACTS User Interface through
the Analysis \> Subject Data tab.

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image46.png"
style="width:4.02538in;height:3.78503in" />

The file format is a comma separated text file. The file must contain
the following fields/columns:

- Subject ID: the id of the subject. This should simply be a numeric
  value. It is unused by the 2D-CRM engine, it is provided as an aid to
  linking the record to actual patient data (if that is what is being
  used). It is useful to give each subject a different Id as errors in
  the file are reported by 2D-CRM using the Subject ID Num:

> <img src="./2DCRM/media/image47.png"
> style="width:1.45787in;height:1.08068in" />

- Cohort ID: the number of the cohort the subject was treated in. This
  should be a simple increasing integer, but of course several subjects
  will belong to the same cohort.

- Dose 1, Dose 2: these should be the **strength** of the dose of Drug 1
  and Drug 2 that the subject was treated with, doses are indexed 1, 2,
  3, …. Max dose.

- Toxicity: this value indicates whether the subject had a dose limiting
  toxicity or not. It should be 0 (to indicate no toxicity) or 1 (to
  indicated toxicity).

- Efficacy: This value is included for future expansion to additionally
  taking an efficacy response into account. It should be 0 or 1. The
  value is currently ignored.

After entering the above into the subjects.csv and then clicking on
“Reload Data”, the Analysis tab looks like this:

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image48.png"
style="width:5.99542in;height:4.55104in" />

We can see that the data has been correctly loaded – 4 subjects with no
toxicity on combination (3mg,400mg), 6 subjects with 2 toxicity on
combination (3mg,800mg) and 6 subjects with 1 toxicity on combination
(6mg,400mg). But as yet no analysis has been run. To run an analysis on
this data, click on “Run Analysis”.

Once the analysis has completed, the screen looks like this …

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image49.png"
style="width:4.99542in;height:3.79196in" />

We can see that the next recommended combinations are (4.5mg,600mg)

In the simulation of the design that has been entered, all the
combinations recommended would be tested by allocating a cohort to each
combination in the next round. In practice the clinical team would
review these recommendations, the results of the model fit and possibly
other data such as minor toxicities observed to form a view as to which
combinations should be tested.

## Analysis tab graphs

After the analysis the graph shown by default is the “Observed
Toxicities” graphs (shown above).

The other three graphs available are similar to the “per cohort” graphs
available for simulations, namely:

- Fitted Pr(Toxicity)

- Pr(Toxicity band)

- Band Summary Graph

### Fitted Pr(Toxicity)

This graph shows the mean fitted toxicity rate at each combination,
colored with increasing intensity the higher the rate, and a summary of
the observed data:

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image50.png"
style="width:5.01075in;height:3.80359in" />

### Pr(Toxicity Band)

This graph shows the posterior probability of being in a particular
toxicity band at each combination, colored with increasing intensity the
higher the probability, and a summary of the observed data:

<img src="./2DCRM/media/image51.png"
style="width:4.99542in;height:3.79196in" />

There is a control to select for which toxicity band the probabilities
are shown.

### Band Summary Graph

This graph shows the posterior probability of being in each toxicity
band at each combination as a simple histogram. Common y-axis range of
0-1 is used for all the histograms. The background of the histograms is
white if the combination is within the overdose control rules and pink
if the combination is excluded by the overdose control rules. At the top
of each histogram is a summary of the observed data (toxicities / total
observed):
