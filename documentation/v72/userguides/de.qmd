# Introduction

## Purpose of this document

This document describes how to install and use the Rule-Based Dose
Escalation (DE) Fixed and Adaptive Clinical Trial Simulator (FACTS)
software (from now on referred to as *Dose Escalation Fixed and Adaptive
Clinical Trial Simulator Software*). It is intended for all end users of
the system.

## Scope of this document

This document covers the Dose Escalation Fixed and Adaptive Clinical
Trial Simulator Software by describing the user interface. It covers the
3+3, mTPI, mTPI-2, i3+3 and BOIN designs. It does not cover the CRM
design engine which has [its own User Guide](crm.qmd). This document
does also not address the internal workings of the design engines or
algorithms, which are addressed in the associated Design Engine
Specification.

The screenshots provided are specific to a particular installation and
may not reflect the exact layout of the information seen by any
particular user. They were taken from FACTS, 5 or later if changed,
installed on Windows 7 and Windows 10. Different versions of Windows or
the use of different Windows themes will introduce some differences in
appearance. The contents of each tab, however, will be consistent with
the software.

## Citing FACTS

Please cite FACTS wherever applicable using [this
citation](../../../introduction/citation.qmd).

## Definition of Terms

An overview of the acronyms and abbreviations used in this document can
be found [here](../../glossary.qmd).

# FACTS Overview

The Fixed and Adaptive Clinical Trial Simulator allows designs for a
clinical trial to be evaluated and compared to traditional designs, thus
allowing designs to be optimized. The designs fit a selected model to
endpoints of interest, and evaluate pre-specified decisions based on the
properties of the fitted model. These decisions may include selecting
the dose to allocate to the next subject, and whether sufficient data
has been gathered to allow the trial to be stopped.

There are currently four non-deprecated design engines for Dose
Escalation FACTS: “3+3”, mTPI, mTPI-2, i3+3, BOIN, CRM and 2D-CRM.

This User Guide covers “3+3”, mTPI, mTPI-2, i3+3 and BOIN.
[CRM](crm.qmd) and [2D-CRM](2dcrm.qmd) have their own user guides.

# The FACTS Rules-Based Dose Escalation GUI

The FACTS Rule-Based Dose Escalation GUI consists of five tabs:

-   The Study Tab for specifying the Treatment Arms (doses) available in
    the study.

-   The Virtual Subject Response tab for specifying response profiles to
    simulate. This is where a set of different toxicities rates per dose
    are specified that should represent the expected ‘space’ of the
    expected dose-toxicity profiles for the compound being tested.

-   The Design tab for specifying the dose escalation method
    (3+3/mTPI/mTPI-2/i3+3/BOIN), maximum number of cohorts and cohort
    size, cohort expansion (yes/no), target toxicity bounds and
    additional rules such as overdose control and stopping rules. These
    are the design choices open to the trial biostatistician. The
    expected consequences of these design choices are to be estimated by
    running simulations of the trials using the various virtual subject
    response profiles defined.

-   On the Simulation Tab, the user controls and runs simulations and
    can view the simulation results.

-   On the Analysis tab, the user can load an example data set and view
    the results of the FACTS analysis of that data using the current
    specified design.

![Tab layout of
FACTS](images/Screenshot%202025-06-30%20at%2007.50.54.png){#fig-fig3}

Also on the menu bar, on the right hand side of the FACTS Window, is a
button labeled “Notes”; clicking this button reveals a simple “notepad”
window in which the user can maintain some simple notes that will be
stored within the “.facts” file.

![The 'Notes' button](deUGattachments/media/image4.png){#fig-fig4}
![Example design notes](deUGattachments/media/image5.png){#fig-fig5}

The notepad window comes with two further buttons: one to change the
window to a free floating one that can be moved away from the FACTCS
window; and the other to close it.

The Notes field can be used for any text the user wishes to store with
the file. Suggested uses are: to record the changes made in a particular
version of a design and why; and to comment on the simulation results.
This will help when coming back to work that has been set aside, to
recall what gave rise to the different version of a design.

## Introduction

To open the application, select FACTS Dose Escalation from your Start
menu. At different points in the FACTS GUI, the user is required to make
decisions about how to model or simulate various aspects of a clinical
trial. To simplify data entry, FACTS shows the user *only* the
information that is relevant to the current decisions.

FACTS has a tabbed design to allow entry of different categories of
information about the design.

The **File** menu allows the user to create a new design, open an
existing design, save a design, or copy a design to a new name (Save
as). The saved design includes all parameters entered as well as
simulation results, if they have been produced.

The **Settings** menu provides the ability to configure how simulation
jobs should be submitted to the Grid. Selecting whether to execute
simulations locally or on the Grid is done from the Simulation tab.

The **Help** menu allows the user to learn more about the FACTS software
and verify the application’s version number.

Finally, note that in all tabs of the application, red exclamation
points

![](deUGattachments/media/image6.png){#fig-fig6}

indicate errors in data entry from the user that must be corrected.
Moving the cursor over the exclamation point causes a pop-up help text
indicating what the error is, helping the user remedy the error.

# Study

## Treatment Arms

The Study \> Treatment Arms tab (@fig-fig17) provides an interface for
specifying the various dose levels.

The user may add doses either explicitly or by auto-generation, as
depicted below. The user may also edit the Dose Names within the table
by double clicking on any existing dose name, however the index cannot
be edited.

![Treatment
Arms](images/Screenshot%202025-06-30%20at%2007.53.39.png){#fig-fig7}

# Virtual Subject Response

The Virtual Subject Response tab allows the user to explicitly define
response profiles. When simulations are executed, they will be run
separately for each profile defined by the user.

## Explicitly Defined

The Virtual Subject Response \> Explicitly Defined \> Toxicity sub-tab
provides an interface for specifying one or more Toxicity profiles.

Toxicity profiles may be added, deleted, and renamed using the table and
corresponding buttons on the left hand side of the screen in @fig-fig18.
Toxicity values are entered directly into the Probability of Toxicity
column of the table, and the graphical representation of these toxicity
values updates accordingly. The graph may be modified by plotting the
log of the dose strength as the x-axis, and by plotting the logit or the
probability of toxicity as the y-axis.

This graph – as with all graphs in the application – may be easily
copied using the ‘Copy Graph’ option in the context menu accessed by
right-clicking on the graph. The user is given the option to copy the
graph to their clipboard (for easy pasting into other applications, such
as Microsoft Word or PowerPoint), or to save the graph as an image file.

![Toxicity Virtual Subject Response
(bCRM)](deUGattachments/media/image18.png){#fig-fig18}

# Design

## Options tab

The first option to choose in the Design \> Options tab is the
underlying algorithm to be used for the escalation, de-escalation and
overdose rules. The choices are:

-   BOIN [@yuan2016bayesian]
-   mTPI [@ji2010modified]
-   mTPI-2 [@guo2017bayesian]
-   i3+3 [@liu2020i3]
-   3+3 [@liu2013up]

![](images/Screenshot%202025-06-27%20at%2016.00.34.png){#fig-figOptionsDesigns}

Options that are common to all algorithms are:

-   Max Number of Cohorts: This in conjunction with the cohort size
    gives the maximum sample size of the trial. After the selected
    number of cohorts have been included, no further cohorts will be
    included and the MTD will be selected according to the respective
    algorithm.
-   Cohort Size: The number of trial participants included in each
    cohort. In 3+3, this defaults to "3" and cannot be changed. The
    maximum sample size of the trial is simply: Max Trial Size (cohorts)
    \* Cohort Size.
-   Cohort Expansion: The user can specify that after the dose
    escalation phase of the trial has completed, the simulation is to
    include an ‘expansion cohort’ (allocated at the final estimate of
    the MTD) and how large that expansion cohort will be.

The further options depend on the chosen design algorithm chosen. Please
select the algorithm of interest to learn more. If you are interested in
mTPI, mTPI-2, BOIN or i3+3, please select "Non 3+3" in the first stage.

:::: panel-tabset
### Non 3+3

Given all the options specified, the matrix of dosing decisions is
displayed on the right hand side. This shows the dosing decision given
the number of subject treated at the current dose and the number of
toxicities observed:

> E Escalate
>
> S Stay
>
> D De-escalate
>
> DU De-escalate and do not revisit

![mTPI Design tab shwoing the decision matrix on the right hand
side](images/Screenshot%202025-06-30%20at%2007.56.22.png){#fig-fig28}

As an example, if the value of row 2, column 6 is "E", the algorithm
would want us to escalate to the next dose if we had observed 2
toxicities in 6 trial participants.

Additional options include:

-   Maximum probability that dose exceeds target toxicity: This is an
    option to prevent re-escalating to a dose (the “DU” or Do not Use
    category in the decision matrix) if the posterior probability (based
    on a Beta-Binomial model per dose) that the toxicity rate is above
    the target toxicity is greater than the selected value (0.95 is the
    default).

-   Stop if next dose already has X subjects: This is an option that
    allows an early stopping rule to be specified that if the dose to be
    allocated next already has the maximum number of subjects on it then
    it is declared the MTD. Setting this value shrinks the size of the
    decision matrix.

-   Target Toxicity boundaries: The user specifies target toxicity rate,
    as well as the lower and upper acceptable bounds on the toxicity
    rate, effectively creating four distinct buckets for doses:

    -   Underdosing: Doses with a toxicity rate falling into the
        \[0,lower bound\] bucket
    -   Target: Doses with a toxicity rate falling into the (lower
        bound,target\] bucket
    -   Excess Toxicity: Doses with a toxicity rate falling into the
        (Target,upper bound\] bucket
    -   Unacceptable Toxicity: Doses with a toxicity rate falling into
        the (Upper bound,1\] bucket

    These bounds are then used in the different algorithms to create the
    decision table.

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
#### BOIN

BOIN has extra options compared to mTPI, mTPI-2 and i3+3:

-   Use default BOIN bounds: Whether or not the lower and upper toxicity
    bound should be calculated automatically using the BOIN defaults
    (lower bound = 0.6\*target, upper bound = 1.4\*target), or whether
    they are chosen by the user.
-   Stay when seeing 1/3 toxicities: Whether or not to overwrite the
    algorithm's decision to stay at the current dose level when seeing 1
    DLT in 3 trial participants. This is useful to mimic the behavior of
    3+3 which is often expected by clinicians.
-   De-escalate when seeing 2/6 toxicities: Whether or not to overwrite
    the algorithm's decision to de-escalate from the current dose level
    when seeing 2 DLTs in 6 trial participants. This is useful to mimic
    the behavior of 3+3 which is often expected by clinicians.
:::

### 3+3

-   Initial dose index: The user may specify the dose level that the
    first cohort will be allocated to. Might be useful in cases where we
    believe there is a (small) chance the initial cohort will experience
    DLTs. In a real world situation, observing too many DLTs on the
    first dose level likely terminates the study, whereas if we had
    started at dose level 2, we have a fall back dose level to
    de-escalate to.
-   Include final validation cohort: Whether to include an additional
    cohort at the chosen MTD after the original 3+3 algorithm has
    terminated.

# Simulation

The Simulation tab allows the user to execute simulations for each of
the scenarios specified for the study. The user may choose the number of
simulations, whether to execute locally or on the Grid, and modify the
random number seeds (@fig-fig36).

If completed results are available, the *actual* number of simulations
run for each scenario is reported in one of the first columns of the
results table. The value displayed in the “Number of Simulations”
control is the number of simulations that *will be* run if the user
clicks on the ‘Simulate’ button.

![Simulation](images/Screenshot%202025-06-30%20at%2007.58.04.png){#fig-fig36}

FACTS uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in the generation of
simulated patient response data and trial results. In order to exactly
reproduce a statistical set of results, it is necessary to start the
Markov Chain from an identical “Random Seed”. The initial random seed
for FACTS simulations is set from the simulation tab, the first thing
that FACTS does is to draw the random number seeds to use at the start
of each simulation. It is possible to re-run a specific simulation, for
example to have more detailed output files generated, by specifying
‘start at simulation’.

Say the 999<sup>th</sup> simulation out of a set displayed some unusual
behavior, in order to understand why, one might want to see the
individual interim analyses for that simulation (the “weeks” file), the
sampled subject results for that simulation (the “Subjects” files) and
possibly even the MCMC samples from the analyses in that simulation. You
can save the .facts file with a slightly different name (to preserve the
existing simulation results), then run 1 simulation of the specific
scenario, specifying that the simulations start at simulation 999 and
that at least 1 weeks file, 1 subjects file and the MCMC samples file
(see the “MCMC settings” dialog) are output.

Even a small change in the random seed will produce different simulation
results.

The same random number seed is used at the start of the simulation of
each scenario. If two identical scenarios are specified then identical
simulation results will be obtained. The same may happen if scenarios or
designs only differ in ways that have no impact on the trials being
simulated, for instance designs that have no adaptation, or scenarios
that don’t trigger any adaptation (e.g. none of the simulations stop
early).

The user can specify:

-   the number of simulations for which ‘Cohorts’ files are written.
    ‘Cohorts’ files record the data, analysis and recommendation at each
    interim (after each cohort).

-   The parallelization packet size, this allows simulation jobs to be
    split into runs of no-more than the specified number of trials to
    simulate. If more simulations of a scenario are requested than can
    be done in one packet, the simulations are started as the requisite
    number of packets and the results combined and summarized when they
    are all complete – so the final results files look just as though
    all the simulations were run as one job or packet. When running
    simulations on the local machine FACTS enterprise version will
    process as many packets in parallel as there are execution threads
    on the local machine. The overhead of packetisation is quite low so
    a packet size of 10 to 100 can help speed up the overall simulation
    process – threads used to simulate scenarios that finish quicker can
    pick up packets for scenarios that take longer, if the number of
    scenarios is no directly divisible by the number of threads
    packetisation uses all threads until the last few packets have to be
    run and finally the “Simulations complete” figure can be updated at
    the end of each packet, so the small the packet the better FACTS can
    report the overall progress.

## To run simulations

Click in the check box in each of the rows corresponding the to the
scenarios to be run. FACTS displays a row for each possible combination
of the ‘profiles’ that have been specified: - baseline response, dose
response, longitudinal response, accrual rate and dropout rate. Or
simply click on “Select All”.

Then click on the “Simulate” button.

During simulation, the user may not modify any parameters on any other
tab of the application. This safeguard ensures that the simulation
results reflect the parameters specified in the user interface.

When simulations are started, FACTS saves all the study parameters, and
when the simulations are complete all the simulation results are saved
in results files in a “\_results” folder in the same directory as the
“.facts” file. Within the “\_results” folder there will be a sub-folder
that holds the results for each scenario.

## How many simulations to run?

-   After first entering a design it is worth running just a small
    number of simulations such as 10 to check that the scenarios and
    design have been entered correctly. If all 10 simulations of a
    ‘null’ scenario are successful, or all 10 simulations of what was
    intended to be an effective drug scenario are futile, it is likely
    there has been a mistake or misunderstanding in the specification of
    the scenarios or the final evaluation or early stopping criteria.

-   Once the design and scenarios look broadly correct, it is usually
    worth quickly collecting rough estimates of the operating
    characteristics using around 100 simulations for each scenario. 100
    simulations is enough to spot designs having very poor operating
    characteristics such as very high type-1 error, very poor power, a
    strong tendency to stop early for the wrong reason, or poor
    probability of selecting the correct target. 100 simulations is also
    usually sufficient to spot problems with the data analysis such as
    poor model fits and significant bias in the posterior estimates.

-   Typically 1,000 simulations of each scenario of interest is required
    to get estimates of the operating characteristics precise enough to
    compare designs and tune the parameters. (Very roughly rates of 5%
    (such as type-1 error) can be estimated to about +/-1.5% and rates
    of around 80% (such as power) estimated +/- 2.5%)

-   Finally around 10,000 simulations of the scenarios of interest is
    required to give confidence in operating characteristics of a design
    and possibly to select between the final shortlisted designs
    (Approximately rates of 5% can be estimated to about +/-0.5% and
    rates of around 80% estimated +/- 1%).

There may be many operating characteristics need to be compared over a
number of scenarios, such as expected sample size, type-1 error, power,
probability of selecting a good dose as the target and quality of
estimation of the dose-response.

However frequently these will be compared over a range of scenarios, it
may not be necessary to run very large number of simulations for each
scenario if a design shows a consistent advantage on the key operating
characteristics over the majority of the scenarios.

### Simulation results

In the main screen the summary results that are usually of principal
interest are displayed, the results summarised by scenario.

-   **Show more columns**: Allows the user to open additional windows on
    the simulation results, the windows available are:

    -   **All**: A window containing all the summary results columns

    -   **Highlights**: (all) a separate window with the results shown
        on the main tab

    -   **Allocation, Observed**: (all) summary results of the number of
        subjects allocated, the number allocated to each dose, the
        number of toxicities observed and the number of toxicities
        observed per dose

    -   **Simulation Results**: a window displaying the individual
        simulation results for each simulation of the currently selected
        scenario

-   **Explore Results**: opens the FACTS built in options for
    visualizing the results for both the currently selected scenario and
    across all scenarios. See Section 11 below for a description of the
    graphs.

-   **Aggregate**: opens a control that allows the user create
    aggregated results files from all the scenarios. The user can select
    which scenarios to include, and whether the results should be
    pivoted by dose. The resulting files are stored in the simulation
    results folder.

-   **Open in R**: If aggregated files have been created then clicking
    this button on the simulations tab will open control that allows the
    user to select which aggregations to load into data frames as R is
    opened. Otherwise it will offer to open R using the files in the
    currently selected scenario.

-   **Right Click Menu:** right clicking the mouse on a row of results
    in the simulation tab brings up a ‘local’ menu of options:

    -   **Open results folder**: Opens a file browser in the results
        folder of the scenario, allowing swift access to any of the
        results files.

    -   **Simulation results**: Opens a window displaying the individual
        simulation results for each simulation of the currently selected
        scenario

    -   **Open in R**: opens a control that will launch R, first loading
        the selected files in the results folder as data frames.

    -   **View Graphs**: launches the graph viewer to view the results
        of the currently selected scenario.

### MCMC Settings

![](images/Screenshot%202025-06-30%20at%2007.59.33.png){#fig-fig37}

The first two values specify two standard MCMC parameters –

-   The length of burn-in is the number of the initial iterations whose
    results are discarded, to allow the sampled values to settle down.

-   The number of samples is the number of subsequent iterations whose
    results are recorded in order to give posterior estimates of the
    values of interest (in this case α and β).

If the **Number of MCMC samples to output** value is set to N, where N
\> 0, then all the sampled values at each interim in the first N
simulations are output, allowing the user to check convergence.

The **MCMC output thinning parameter** can be used to reduce the amount
of data output to the MCMC file. It does not reduce the amount of MCMC
samples used within the model fitting.

To obtain the MCMC sampled values for a particular simulation, keep the
same Random number seed and use **Start at simulation** to specify the
simulation in question and run just 1 simulation.

## FACTS Grid Simulation Settings

If you have access to a computational grid, you may choose to have your
simulations run on the grid instead of running them locally. This frees
your computer from the computationally intensive task of simulating so
you can continue other work or even shutdown your PC or laptop. In order
to run simulations on the grid, it must first be configured, this is
normally done via a configuration file supplied with the FACTS
installation by the IT group responsible for the FACTS installation.

## Detailed Simulation Results

After simulation has completed and simulation results have been loaded,
the user may examine detailed results for any scenario with simulation
data in the table by double-clicking on the row. A separate window (as
in @fig-fig38) will reveal more detailed results about the simulation.

![Detailed Simulation Results for a particular scenario](images/Screenshot 2025-06-30 at 08.04.03.png){#fig-fig38}

Right-clicking on a row displays a context menu from which the user can
also view the corresponding cohort results:

![Cohort Results for a particular simulation](images/Screenshot 2025-06-30 at 08.05.47.png){#fig-fig39}

## Aggregation

Aggregation combines the csv output from multiple scenarios into fewer
csv files. The Aggregate… button displays a dialog which allows the user
to select what to aggregate.

![](deUGattachments/media/image40.png){#fig-fig40}

The default location for the aggregated files is the results directory
for the study, but this can be changed.

Aggregation may be performed with or without pivoting on group, or both.

-   Unpivoted files will have one row for each row in the original
    files.

-   In pivoted files each original row will be split into one row per
    dose, plus two extra rows for ‘below lowest’ and ‘above highest’.

    -   Where there is a group of columns for each dose, they will be
        turned into a single column with each value on a new row.

    -   If there is no value for the below lowest or above highest rows,
        they will be left blank.

    -   Values in columns that are independent of group will be repeated
        on each row.

The default is to aggregate all scenarios, but any combination may be
selected.

Pressing “Aggregate” generates the aggregated files.

Each type of csv file is aggregated into a separate csv file whose name
begins agg\_ or agg_pivot\_, so agg_summary.csv will contain the rows
from each of the summary.csv files, unpivoted. cohortsNNN.csv files are
aggregated into a single agg\_\[pivot\_\]cohorts.csv file. Doses.csv is
identical for all scenarios and so is not aggregated.

Each aggregated file begins with the following extra columns, followed
by the columns from the original csv file:

| Column Name | Comments |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Scenario ID | Index of the scenario |
| Toxicity Profile | A series of columns containing the names of the various profiles used to construct the scenario. Columns that are never used are omitted. |
| Agg Timestamp | Date and time when aggregation was performed |
| Sim | Simulation number. Only present in the cohorts file. |
| Dose | Only present if pivoted |

# The Summary Results Columns

## Highlights (All)

These are the columns displayed on the simulations tab after simulations
are completed, the can also be displayed in the separate “Highlights”
results window.

| Column Title | Number of columns | Engines | Description |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Select | 1 | All | Not an output column, this column contains check box to allow the user to select which scenario to simulate. The ‘Select All’ button causes them all to be checked. |
| Status | 1 | All | This column reports on the current status of simulations: Completed, Running, No Results, Out of date, Error. It is updated automatically. |
| Scenario | 1 | All | This gives the name of the scenario. In the N-CRM this is simply the name of the Toxicity response profile to be simulated (in other Design Engines the scenario may be a combination of a number of profiles – e.g. one for the toxicity response and one for the efficacy response). |
| Num Sims | 1 | All | The number of simulations that were run to produce the displayed results. |
| Random Number Seed | 1 | All | Base random number seed used to perform the simulations. |
| Mean Subj. | 1 | All | This is the mean (over the simulations) of the number of subjects recruited in this scenario. |
| PPn. Tox | 1 | All | This is the average proportion of the subjects recruited that experienced a toxicity in the simulations of this scenario. |
| SD Ppn. Tox | 1 | All | This is the standard deviation of the proportion of toxicity across the simulations of this scenario. |
| True Ppn Tox | 1 | All | This is the average true probability of toxicity over the simulations. The ‘true probability of toxicity’ in a simulated trial is the average of the probabilities of toxicity all the subjects are exposed to, given the toxicity response profile of the scenario. |
| MTD Selection: \<dose\> | One per dose | All | For each dose, this is proportion of the simulations where it was selected as the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) at the end of the study. The dose chosen will be the dose with the highest posterior probability being the MTD (closest dose to having the target toxicity rate – or “nearest below” or “nearest above” as selected by the user on the Study Info tab. |
| Ppn(All Tox) | 1 | All | The proportion of the simulations that stopped because all doses were too toxic. |
| Ppn(Early Success) | 1 | All | The proportion of the simulations that stopped because sufficient stopping rules were met before the maximum number of cohorts had been treated. |
| Ppn(Cap) | 1 | All | The proportion of the simulations that stopped because the maximum number of cohorts had been treated. |

## Allocations, Observed

| Column Title | Number of columns | Engines | Description |

# Graphs of Simulation Results

The ‘View Graph’ button on the simulation tab also allows the user to
view Summary graphs for the currently selected row of data in the
summary results table. A separate Summary Graphs window will appear. The
types of graphs available for viewing are listed in the left-hand side
of the window; clicking on a graph type displays that graph. Note that
some graphs will not be available if they are not relevant to the type
of design the user has simulated. By right clicking on the graph the
user can access the context menu that allows a copy of the graph to be
copied to the Windows’ clipboard or saved as an image (‘.png’) file.

## Allocation Box and Whisker plot

![Allocation Box and Whisker
plot](deUGattachments/media/image42.png){#fig-fig42}

This graph displays a box and whisker plot of the number of subjects
allocated to each dose over the simulations. These plots show:

-   The mean allocation over all simulations at each dose plotted as a
    solid line.

-   The median value is plotted as a dashed line.

-   The 25-75<sup>th</sup> quantile range is plotted as the “box”
    portion of each point.

-   The “whiskers” extend to the largest and smallest values within 1 ½
    times the interquartile range from either end of the box.

-   Points outside the whisker range are considered outliers, and are
    plotted as small blue dots. Note that it may be difficult to see all
    of these symbols if they are plotted at the same value.

## MTD Distribution

| **3+3 version** | **CRM Toxicity, CRM Ordinal, bCRM - MTD** |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| ![](deUGattachment%20s/media/image46.png){#fig-fig46} | ![](deUGattachment%20s/media/image47.png){#fig-fig47} |
| **CRM Efficacy, bCRM - MED** | **bCRM – OSD and TE** |
| ![](deUGattachment%20s/media/image48.png){#fig-fig48} | ![](deUGattachment%20s/media/image49.png){#fig-fig49} |

These graphs show the proportion of times each dose has been selected as
a particular target dose as a brown bar, along with lines showing the
mean estimated toxicity/efficacy and the simulated ‘true’
toxicity/efficacy. The ‘error’ bars on the mean estimated
toxicity/efficacy are the 95% interval of the mean estimates across the
simulations.

## “Toxicity and Allocation” / “Obs Tox and Alloc” / “Obs Efficacy and Allocation”

| **3+3 version, CRM Toxicity, CRM Ordinal, bCRM** | **CRM Efficacy, bCRM** |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| ![](deUGattachment%20s/media/image50.png){#fig-fig50} | ![](deUGattachment%20s/media/image51.png){#fig-fig51} |

These graph show the mean allocation to each dose and the mean number of
toxicities/efficacies observed at each dose.

## Sample Size MTD Histogram

![](deUGattachments/media/image53.png){#fig-fig53}

This graph plots the distribution of the final sample sizes a a stacked
bar chart with different shades of color indicating the proportion of
simulations with that sample size had selected the different doses as
MTD.

## Simulation Allocation History

|                                                       |             |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 3+3 version, CRM Toxicity, bCRM                       | CRM Ordinal |
| ![](deUGattachment%20s/media/image56.png){#fig-fig56} |             |
| CRm Efficacy, bCRM                                    |             |

This graph shows the allocation and toxicity/efficacy history for an
individual simulation. Each dot represents a subject, the dot is colored
red if toxicity was observed, light pink for a mild toxicity, blue for
efficacy and grey otherwise. The subjects’ outcomes are displayed left
to right in the order in which they were dosed, and at a height
corresponding to the dose they were given.

The graph includes a drop down selector box allowing the user to select
which simulated trial is displayed. A history can only be displayed for
trials for which a ‘cohorts’ file has been written out.

## Cohort Responses

| **CRM Toxicity** | **CRM Ordinal** |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| ![](deUGattachment%20s/media/image57.png){#fig-fig57} | ![](deUGattachment%20s/media/image58.png){#fig-fig58} |
| **bCRM** |  |
| ![](deUGattachment%20s/media/image59.png){#fig-fig59} |  |

This graph shows the dose allocation and resulting toxicities/efficacies
along with the fitted dose-toxicity/efficacy model for a single
simulated trial after the results have been gathered for a specific
cohort of a specific trial.

The graph includes a drop down selector box allowing the user to select
which simulated trial is displayed, and a further drop down selector box
allowing the user to select at which cohort to display the state of the
trial.

These details can only be displayed for trials for which a ‘cohorts’
file has been written out.

## MTD Change on Expansion

![MTD change on expansion
graph](deUGattachments/media/image60.png){#fig-fig60}

This graph plots the dose selected as MTD before the results of the
expansion cohort are available, against the dose selected as MTD after
the expansion cohort results are available. Each simulation result is
plotted as a ‘dot’, and the graph is divided up into a grid and dots
located in the correct cell in the grid and then arranged within the
cell depending on how many results fall into the cell. This allows the
relative number of results in each cell to be appraised quickly by eye.

This graph allows the trial designer to see the degree of risk that the
determination of the MTD will change as a result of the expansion cohort
and whether the risk is predominantly that the determination will
increase or decrease.

There are similar graphs showing the change in the estimate of the MED
and OSD after the expansion cohort.

# Output Files

FACTS stores the results of simulations as csv files under a Results
folder. For each row in the simulations table, there is a folder named
by concatenating the names of all the different parts, which contains
the corresponding csv files.

Right-clicking on a row in any of the results tables displays a context
menu from which includes an option to open the results folder in
explorer.

These files can be opened using Microsoft Excel, but versions before
2007 are restricted to 256 columns, which is too few to view some files
in their entirety. Open Office will show all the columns and it will
allow you to open two files that have the same name.

There are several types of file:

**Summary.csv** – contains a single row of data that holds data
summarized across the simulations. This is the source of most of the
values in the simulations table.

**Simulations.csv** – contains one row per simulation describing the
final state of each simulation.

**CohortsNNN.csv** – contains one row for each cohort during a
simulation where NNN is the number of the simulation. By default this
file is written only for the first 100 simulations, but this can be
changed via the advanced button on the simulation tab.
