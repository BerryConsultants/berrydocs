In FACTS Core TTE, 'predictor endpoints' can be used in a similar way to
early observations of the clinical endpoint measure in FACTS Core
Continuous and Dichotomous. That is, they are used to inform the
analysis about what the final outcome is likely to be for subjects for
whom the final outcome has not <span class="custom-tooltip"> yet been observed <span class="tooltip-text">If a subject drop's out, their final endpoint will never be observed, but their predictors are still used to impute the subject's possibly final time to event if the predictor is observed before the dropout.</span> </span>. The estimates of
the predictor response can also be used in QOIs, and thus somewhat like
an additional endpoint and used for decision making.

The dose-predictor model is used to impute subjects' predictor responses
based on their treatment allocation when their predictor response has
not yet been observed. The predictor-endpoint model is used to impute
their time to final endpoint when that has not yet been observed.

The differences between predictor endpoints in FACTS Core TTE
and early endpoints with longitudinal modeling in FACTS Core Continuous
and Dichotomous are that:

-   There is only one observation of a predictor per-subject, there may
    be multiple early observations per subject of the clinical endpoint for use in a longitudinal model.

-   In FACTS Continuous and Dichotomous, longitudinal modelling is over
    time. There is no response modeling of early observations **across**
    doses, longitudinal modeling is either for different doses or
    pooled.

-   In FACTS TTE the design can include a dose-predictor model that

    -   Allows subjects' predictor event endpoint to be imputed (Imputation is
        described in the FACTS Core Design Guide).

    -   Allows early stopping decisions to taken based on the estimates
        of the dose-predictor model.

For all predictor responses ($Z$) for time-to-event endpoints, the engine estimates
both a marginal predictor distribution (normal mean and variance for continuous,
probability of response for dichotomous, or a piecewise exponential
hazard model for time to event predictors), and a working model relating
the predictor to the final endpoint. The marginal predictor distribution is used
to impute predictors for subjects lacking an observed predictor value,
and may also be used for stopping (see section on stopping). The working
model is used to impute final event times for subjects lacking a final
endpoint. For subject missing both a predictor and final endpoint, the
predictor is imputed first from its marginal distribution, and then the
final endpoint is imputed conditionally on the predictor $Z$.

# Dose Response Model

## Continuous & Dichotomous Predictors

For the predictor model with a continuous or dichotomous predictor,
there are two tabs within the Design > Predictor Model tab -- the Dose Response and the Relationship to Endpoint
tabs.

The dose response model for the predictor is the model used to estimate
the marginal distribution of the predictor response at each dose as a
normal mean and variance for a continuous endpoint or mean and
variance of the log-odds for a dichotomous endpoint. The dose response
options are as per the [continuous and dichotomous endpoint standard dose response options](../design/doseresponse.qmd) (except that the use of BAC for the predictor is not supported).
The predictor dose-response model can be selected and specified
completely independently of the dose response model for the primary
time-to-event endpoint (the model of the log hazard ratio).

![The dichotomous predictor model showing a Simple NDLM dose response. The NDLM model for the predictor response works exactly like the NDLM dose response model.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image40.png){#fig-predNDLM}

### Continuous Predictor

Within each dose (including control and active comparator), the marginal
distribution of the predictor $Z$ is a normal distribution with mean $\theta_{Zd}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_Z$. The
standard deviation is common across the doses, but the means
$\theta_{Zd}$ are allowed to vary across the same range of doses based on the
predictor's dose response model. The dose response for the predictor does not
need to match the dose response for the final endpoint, and the two models
are estimated independently of eachother.

### Dichotomous Predictor

A dichotomous predictor is handled similarly to a continuous predictor,
with the predictor's marginal distribution having its own dose response model.
Like in the typical dose response model on a dichotomous endpoint when it is
the primary endpoint, the dose response model estimates the log-odds of the
response rate for each dose.

## Time-to-Event Predictor

For the predictor model with a time-to-event predictor, there are three
tabs within the Design > Predictor Model tab -- the Hazard Model, Dose Response, and the Relationship to Endpoint tabs.

As in the response model for the primary event, the response model for a
time to event predictor comprises a hazard model of the predictor for the event rate on
the control arm, and a dose response model used to estimate the marginal
distribution of the non-control dose predictor response for each dose as a normal log-hazard ratio.

The hazard model and dose response options for the predictor endpoint are similar
to the hazard model and dose response options for the primary time-to-event
endpoint, except that the use of
the cox model or BAC for the predictor hazard model is not supported.
The predictor dose-response model is selected, specified, and estimated
completely independently of the dose response model for the
time-to-event endpoint.

# Relationship to Endpoint Model

On the Relationship to Endpoint tab, the user specifies the prior
distributions for the relationship to endpoint model.

The relationship to endpoint model determines how the early predictor data impacts
the primary time-to-event endpoint. After the dose response model for the
predictor endpoint is calculated, the subjects with both a predictor value and a
primary endpoint event are used to estimate the relationship to endpoint model, described below.
Then, with this model calculated, all subjects who have a known predictor endpoint value, but do not
have an observed primary endpoint event have their time to event imputed conditional on their
predictor endpoint value.

It is possible to specify a minimum information (subjects with both
predictor outcomes and final events) before the predictor model is used
to impute time-to-event for subjects where their final event has not
yet been observed. It also possible to disable the imputation
completely, and simply have the predictor endpoint and final event be
modelled separately.

### Tips on Prior Strength and Informative Priors

If the main use of the predictor is to improve the information for
the final analysis, unless the trial has a particularly small sample
size, usually weak priors can be used so the model is driven by the
data observed in the trial.

If the model is to be used to improve the information at interim
analyses, and even at the first interim there will be some events
observed to allow an initial model to be fitted (even though it
might have a very diffuse posterior), again weak priors can be used.

If the model is to be used to allow interim analyses before any
events are likely to have been seen, then informative priors are
necessary.

When there is a need to set informative priors, one way to establish the
values to use is to estimate them from simulations using external data
file based on actual data.

Method

1.  Create a simple, fixed trial with a sample size (per arm) of the
    weight of the prior desired, with non-informative priors for the
    predictor model.

2.  Create an external file of actual data, or data sampled from the
    prior predictor-time-to-event model with at least as many samples per arm
    as the sample size in step 1.

3.  Run 100 simulations and take the averages of the posterior estimates
    of the predictor model parameters to use as informative values in
    the actual design.

## Continuous and Dichotomous Predictors

The relationship to endpoint model is:

-   $T_{i} \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda_{d}\ e^{\beta Z_{i}})$ for a
    continuous predictor where $Z_i$, is the observed value of the
    predictor for the $i$^th^ subject

-   $T_{i} \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda_{d}\ e^{\beta Z_{i}})$ for a
    dichotomous predictor where $Z_i=0$ or $1$ is the observed dichotomous
    predictor for the i^th^ subject

That is, for the i^th^ subject, the time to their event is taken to
follow an exponential distribution with mean $\lambda_d\ e^{\beta Z_i}$.

![The Relationship to Endpoint tab for a continuous or dichotomous predictor.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image41.png){#fig-reltoendpoint}

For both continuous and dichotomous predictors, the priors on the $\beta$ and $\lambda_d$ parameters are:

$$ \lambda_d \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha_d, \beta_d) $$

$$  $\beta \sim \text{N}(m, s)$$

$\lambda_d$ is esimated independently for all doses. The coefficient $\beta$ does not have a subscript, because it is constant across
all doses.

For the dichotomous predictor, we can simplify the notation of the relationship
to endpoint model since $Z$ can only be two different values (0 or 1).

$$T\mid (Z=0) \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda_d)$$ and $$T \mid (Z=1) \sim Exp(\lambda_d e^{\beta})$$.

### Notes on priors for continuous/dichotomous relationshipt to endpoint models

For a continuous predictor, $\lambda_d$ is the dose dependent hazard rate
when the predictor is 0. For a dichotomous predictor
$\lambda_d$ is the dose dependent hazard rate when the predictor is 0. The $\lambda$s have
independent gamma priors for each dose, specified by their expected mean
and a weight in equivalent number of events seen. Thus, a weight of 1
would be very weakly informative with any normal number of events.
A weight of 0.1 would be uninformative with even a small number of events.
A way to think about the use of a weight of $>1$ is, if weight of $n>1$ is
used, then after $n$ actual events are observed the
posterior mean estimate of $\lambda$ will be the average of the observed mean and
the prior mean.

The $\beta$ parameter has a normal prior, specified by its
prior mean and standard deviation. For a continuous predictor, this is
the log scaling factor of the hazard rate for the correlation of the
event rate to the predictor. For a dichotomous predictor, it is the log
scaling factor of the hazard rate for subjects who have had response on
the predictor. For a continuous predictor with the center and scale values set so that the
value of $Z$ will vary approximately between $-1$ and $1$, and a dichotomous
predictor where the predictor value is $0$ or $1$, a prior distribution of
$N(0,5)$ for $\beta$ would mean that $e^{\beta Z}$ will take values between $22,000^{-1}$ to
22,000 and the prior could be deemed to be essentially uninformative.
Large values (\>\>5) for the SD of the prior for $\beta$ can lead to numeric
overflow in the simulator. If the values of Z do not largely fall in the range
$[-1, 1]$, it is suggested that the prior for $\beta$ be constructed to limit the coefficient
$\exp{(Z\beta)}$ to lie within its plausible range. If the prior for $\beta$ is left
uninformative and $Z$ can take values $>> 1$ it can result in inflation
in the uncertainty in the estimates of the hazard ratios of subject's
time to final event from a few extreme imputed time-to-event values
for subjects whose times-to-event are imputed, particularly if their
predictor value is imputed too.

## Time-to-Event Predictor

For the time-to-event predictor, the relationship to endpoint model is
simply a per-dose hazard rate for the time from the predictor event to
the final event. For each dose, the user specifies the parameters of a
gamma prior distribution for this 'post-predictor event' hazard rate.
This model is a simple exponential, not piecewise.

![The Relationship to Endpoint tab for the time-to-event engine with a time-to-event predictor.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image42.png){#fig-reltoendpointttepred}

The time-to-event predictor is qualitatively different than the
continuous or dichotomous predictors. Instead of the predictor adjusting
the hazard, the time-to-event predictor is viewed as an offset. The
final endpoint is viewed as a sum of a predictor time $Z_1$ and a post-predictor time $Z_2$, where $Z_1$ and
$Z_2$ are independent random variables and the final endpoint is thus $Z_1 + Z_2$.

For the relationship to endpoint model, $Z_1 \sim PWExp(\lambda_{1s}*\theta_{1d})$ and $Z_2 \sim Exp(\lambda_{2d})$, with priors
$\theta_{1s} \sim Gamma(\alpha_{1s}, \beta_{1s})$, $\theta_{2d} \sim Gamma(\alpha_{2d}, \beta_{2d})$
(with $Z_1$’s control hazard model potentially being piecewise
exponential).

For imputation of the primary endpoint event time, a subject missing both the biomarker and
final endpoint times has both $Z_1$ and $Z_2$
imputed, with the final endpoint imputed as the sum of the two. For a subject with
a predictor time but no final endpoint, $Z_2$ is imputed and
added to the observed predictor time to impute the final endpoint.
