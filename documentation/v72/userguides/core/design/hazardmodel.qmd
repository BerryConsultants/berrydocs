The two main differences in the design tabs available for a time-to-event
endpoint, rather than continuous or dichotomous, are ways that the control arm
hazard model is defined and the use of a predictor model.

# Hazard Model

The hazard model is how the hazard rate on the control arm is modeled. In the
continuous and dichotomous engines the control arm and the active arms have
their own estimated response rate (mean or probability of response) that can
be compared to the control arm. When using a time-to-event endpoint the control
arm has an estimated hazard rate, and each active arm has an estimated
hazard ratio that, when applied to the control arm hazard rate, provides its
hazard rate.

There are essentially two different models for modeling the
control hazard rate:

First is the Cox proportional hazards model, which is a non-parametric model
that requires no prior distributions or model specification. The treatment effects are
estimated as modifiers to the non-parametric survival curve estimate.

Second is the Piecewise exponential model. In this model, the observation period
can be divided into separate time segments, and the hazard rate is
estimated separately in each. When specifying the prior distributions for
the hazard rates within time segments there are two different methods of
specifying the prior - fixed priors or hierarchical priors. The time segments
used in modeling the hazard rates can be different from those used in the specification
of visits, VSRs, or dropout rates.

## Fixed priors

If "Enable hierarchical data modeling for the control arm" is not selected, then independent gamma distributions with parameters
specified in Hazard Rate tab's table are used. The gamma parameters have been
reparameterized so that the mean hazard rate and a weight (in terms of number
of events) are provided instead of the traditional $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters.

## Hierarchical Prior

If "Enable hierarchical data modeling for the control arm" is selected, then
the independent priors specified per segment are augmented by additional data
specified on the "Hierarchical Priors" tab.

![Specifying the sufficient statistics and hierarchical models hyper-parameters for the bayesian augmented control model.](../coreUGattachments/tte/media/image45.png){#fig-ttebac}

The additional data comes in the form of sufficient statistics from an outside
data source. The sufficient statistics are, for each segment in each study, the number of events on the
control arm and the control arm exposure time in subject weeks. The information
from the prior study can be 'down-weighted' by reducing, pro-rata,
the number of events and exposure time before entering them.
By supplying the summary statistics
from previous trials and specifying the parameters for prior distributions for
the parameters of a hierarchical model, the gamma priors are updated and become
the priors applied to the data collected on the virtual subjects.

The hyper-parameters are the mean and standard deviation of
Normal distribution for the log hazard ratios of the event rates of
the historical studies and the current study. The prior distribution for
the mean hyper-parameter is a Normal distribution, for which the user
specifies the mean and standard deviation. The prior distribution for the
standard deviation hyper-parameter is an Inverse-Gamma distribution for which
the user specifies either as a mean and a weight, or via Alpha and Beta
parameters (depending on the user selection on Settings \> Options \> Gamma
Distribution Parameters).

## Setting the priors for Hierarchical model hyper parameters

Unless the intent is to add information that is not included in the
historic studies, the hyper parameters can and should be set so that
they are 'weak' priors, centered on the expected values.

In this case the following would be reasonable:

-   Set the prior mean value for Mu as the mean of the log-hazard
    ratios of the event rates of the control arm and the historic
    studies (usually this will be 0)

-   Set the prior SD for Mu equal to at least the largest log hazard
    ratio of the event rates for the historic studies.

-   Set the mean for tau to the same value as the prior SD for Mu.

-   Set the weight for tau to be \< 1.

One can traverse the spectrum from 'complete pooling of data' to
'completely separate analyses' through the prior for tau. If the
weight of the prior for tau is small relative to the number of
studies, then (unless set to a very extreme value) the mean of the
prior for tau will have little impact and the degree of borrowing
will depend on the observed data.

To give some prior preference towards pooling or separate analysis
the **weight** for tau has to be large, relative to the number of
historic studies. To have a design that is like pooling the
historic studies, the **mean** for tau needs to be small -- say 10% or
less of the value suggested above. For there to be no borrowing from
the historic studies the value for tau needs to be large -- say 10x or
more the value suggested above.

The best way to understand the impact of the priors is try different
values and run simulations.
