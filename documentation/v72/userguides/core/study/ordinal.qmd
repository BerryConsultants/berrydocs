# Study Info

The Study Info sub-tab provides parameters for specifying rules and methods
for common clinical trial simulation features. These include accrual style,
<!--- visit schedule, ## not yet implemented in ordinal  --->
whether interim analyses will be simulated, and more.

<!--- ![The study tab for an ordinal trial.](../coreUGattachments/dichotomous/media/image3.png){#fig-studyd} --->

## Design Options:

In the design options section of the Study tab the user gets check boxes for
whether they want to enable adaptive features, and whether they wish to use
the cumulative logistic family of dose-response models or independent Dirichlet
models for the ordinal endpoint.  
(Longitudinal modelling and simulation of baseline are available 
for other FACTS endpoints but not yet for Ordinal.)
These options have the following effects on
the trial simulation.

### Enable adaptive features

Whether the design is adaptive or fixed. If "adaptive features"
are enabled, some adaptive specific parameters and tabs are added
to the GUI, such as the tabs for defining interims, early
stopping criteria, and adaptive allocation.
<!---
### Use longitudinal modeling

Whether longitudinal modeling is going to be used. If
longitudinal modeling is not selected, some longitudinal specific
parameters and tabs are hidden. If use longitudinal modeling is selected,
FACTS expects that the early endpoint data will be used, it cannot be ignored.
If intermediate data is not intended to be used in the modeling, then it should
not be simulated in FACTS.

## Trial Information:

The trial information section allows the user to specify how subject accrual
should be simulated, and whether a larger endpoint value indicates improvement
or not.

### Recruit Subjects

Subject accrual can be configured to be done continuously or
deterministically.

If recruited continuously, the user recruitment will be
simulated stochastically with a Poisson process, using the
parameters specified on the Execution \> Accrual tab.

If recruited deterministically, the user specifies the recruitment
date of every subject recruited by uploading a file of dates on
the Execution \> Accrual tab.

### Response:

Indicate whether a higher ordinal index indicates improving
or worsening for the participant.  The directions of Wilcoxon tests, Dichotomized Ordinal Tests, 
and Frequentist Proportional Odds models are defined by this selection.  If the user has selected 
Cumulative Logistic modeling, selecting "Higher ordinal index is improvement" 
here implies that an odds ratio greater than 1 corresponds to an arm 
that is superior to control.  Correspondingly, if Lower ordinal index is improvement, 
then an arm with an odds ratio smaller than 1 is superior to control.  If the user 
has selected Dirichlet modeling, then for the purpose of posterior probability quantities 
and t-tests, an arm that is superior to control is one with a large expected utility, 
regardless of what is selected here.

## Ordinal Values

This is where the user defines the number of possible values of the ordinal endpoint.  They can be set explicitly using the Add button or Auto-Generated.  The user may give names to the ordinal values by clicking in the Name column and entering text.  

Here the user also enters Utility values for the possible outcomes, where large values of Utility 
are meant to represent positive outcomes.  It is possible to create good designs in FACTS without 
taking the Utility values entered here seriously, but we encourage users to think carefully 
about which outcomes are better than others and by how much.  In particular, when Dirichlet outcome 
modeling has been selected, all posterior probability quantities of interest are based on Expected Utility
(i.e. the mathematical expectation of the Utility according to the probabilities of each outcome).  When Cumulative 
Logistic modeling has been selected, Utilities are less critical, because posterior probability 
quantities of interest are based on Odds Ratios.  At a minimum, the utility values entered here should agree with 
whether Higher or Lower ordinal index is improvement as selected in the Trial Information section.  

# Treatment Arms

As with all FACTS Core engines, the Treatment Arms sub-tab provides an
interface for specifying the various dose levels, Control and Additional
Comparator arms.  2D treatment arm models are not supported in FACTS Ordinal.

The user may add doses either explicitly or by auto-generation.

The index column provides the ordering of the doses, as well as the number
that will be used to subset the dose in dose response models and FACTS output.
The dose name column is editable by the user, and is used to identify the
doses in the VSR tab as well as in the simulation output shown on the Simulation
tab. Effective Dose Strengths ($v_d$) are the relative strength values of the doses,
and are the values used in the dose response model analysis as $v_d$. They have
no units, but the proximity of doses to other doses will determine the amount of
information sharing that occurs between doses in certain dose response models.
Dose levels <span class="custom-tooltip"> may not be edited directly <span class="tooltip-text">The doses in the design become linked to many other parameters, if dose levels could be edited this could change the effective order of doses and keeping the other parameters settings associated with the right doses becomes problematic â€“ in different circumstances the user might want values to stay with the particular treatment arm or stay with the particular slot in the treatment arm ranking. Forcing doses to be deleted and re-entered if their dose level changes </span> </span> -- to change a dose level, delete the entry and add a new
dose with the correct level.

<!--- ![The Study > Treatment Arms tab.](../coreUGattachments/dichotomous/media/image16.png){#fig-treatmentarmsd} --->

In FACTS Ordinal, a control arm must always be included.  Many default QOIs
compare experimental arms to control, while frequentist tests, predictive probabilities,
and conditional power are based on comparisons to the control arm.  

The active comparator arm can be compared against in posterior probability QOIs, and is
always modelled independently in the dose response model.


# Variants

On this tab the user can specify that a number of design variants should
be created. Currently, the only design feature that can be changed is the
sample size (maximum number of subjects).

If "multiple variants" is checked, then the user can specify that
simulations setups should be created for each simulation scenario with
versions of the design with a different maximum number of subjects.

The user enters the number of variants they wish to create. Then in the
resulting table, enter different "Maximum Subjects" for each variant. On
the simulations tab FACTS will then create a copy of all the scenarios
to run with each variant.
