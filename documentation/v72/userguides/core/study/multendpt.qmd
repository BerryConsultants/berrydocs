# Study Info

The Study Info sub-tab provides parameters for specifying rules and methods
for common clinical trial simulation features. These include accrual style,
visit schedule, whether interim analyses will be simulated, and more.

![The Study > Study Info tab for a multiple endpoint trial](../coreUGattachments/multendpt/media/image3.png){#fig-studyme}

The study tab is simpler for multiple endpoint than it is for other FACTS Core
design engines (Continuous, Dichotomous, or Time-to-event). Some options that
are endpoint specific have been moved to the Endpoints tab, which only exists
in the multiple endpoint engine.

## Design Options:

In the design options section of the Study tab the user gets a check box for
whether they want to enable adaptive features or not. Endpoint specific choices about using longitudinal modelling or special longitudinal options are moved
to the Endpoints tab.

### Enable adaptive features

Specify whether the design is adaptive or fixed. If "adaptive features"
are enabled, some adaptive specific parameters and tabs are added
to the GUI, such as the tabs for defining interims, early
stopping criteria, and adaptive allocation.

## Study Information:

The study information section allows the user to specify how many subjects to accrue and how subject accrual
should be simulated.

### Maximum Number of Subjects

Specify the maximum number of subjects that can be enrolled in the trial. Adaptive designs may stop sooner than this value, but no simulation can ever go past it.

### Recruit Subjects

In multiple endpoint, subject accrual can only be done
continuously or deterministically.

If recruited continuously, the user recruitment will be
simulated stochastically with a Poisson process, using the
parameters specified on the Execution \> Accrual tab.

If recruited deterministically, the user specifies the recruitment
date of every subject recruited by uploading a file of dates on
the Execution \> Accrual tab.

### Overall Schedule of Post-Baseline Visits

The overall visit schedule is specified here. It's called the "overall" visit
schedule in the multiple endpoint engine because the visits entered here make up
the set of all visits where any of the endpoints can be observed. When the details of the
different endpoints are entered on the Endpoints tab, you will be able to specify which
of these visits each endpoint is observed at and which visit will be
the final observation for that endpoint.

![The Study Tab in the Multiple Endpoint engine.](../coreUGattachments/multendpt/media/image15.png){#fig-visitschedme}

Visits can be specified one at a time by entering the required week
value for the visit and then clicking 'Add', or by specifying a
regularly spaced sequence: select 'Auto-Generate', enter the number of
visits, the week of the first visit and the number of weeks between
each visit and then click 'Generate'.

Individual visits can be deleted by selecting them in the list and
clicking 'Delete'. The default visit names can be edited by clicking
the visit name and typing. The week and the index cannot be changed.
Should it be necessary to change the week of a visit, the incorrect
visit must be deleted and a new one with the correct week number
added.

# Treatment Arms

As with all FACTS Core engines, the Treatment Arms sub-tab provides an
interface for specifying the various dose levels, Control and Additional
Comparator arms, and whether using a 2D treatment arm model.

The user may add doses either explicitly or by auto-generation.

The index column provides the ordering of the doses, as well as the number
that will be used to subset the dose in dose response models and FACTS output.
The dose name column is editable by the user, and is used to identify the
doses in the VSR tab as well as in the simulation output shown on the Simulation
tab. Effective Dose Strength ($v_d$) are the relative strength values of the doses,
and are the values used in the dose response model analysis as $v_d$. They have
no units, but the proximity of doses to other doses will determine them amount of
information sharing that occurs between doses in certain dose response models.
Dose levels may not be edited directly -- to change a dose level, delete the entry and add a new
dose with the correct level.

![The Study > Treatment Arms tab.](../coreUGattachments/multendpt/media/image16.png){#fig-treatmentsme}

If "Include a control arm" is selected at the top of the Treatment Arms tab, then
a control will be included in the table. Including a control arm causes many default QOIs
to compare to control and sets frequentist tests, predictive probabilities,
and conditional power to compare against the control arm rather than
an OPC, among other things.

The active comparator arm can be compared against in posterior probability QOIs, and is
always modelled independently in the dose response model.

## 2D Treatment Arm Model

If the user checks the "Use 2D treatment arm model" option, the screen
changes to allow the treatment strengths to be specified on 2 axes, and
to specify which of the treatment combinations thus created will
actually included as arms in the trial.

![The Study > Treatment Arms tab when using a 2D treatment arm model.](../coreUGattachments/multendpt/media/image17.png){#fig-2dtreatmentme}

The user now specifies strengths as "Column Factors" and "Row factors".
For example, the Column factors could be different dose strengths and
the row factors could be different dosing regimens, or different
treatments that the investigational treatment could be combined with.
Because of the way the factors are shown in FACTS graphs it is better to
use the factor with the greater number of values as the column factor.
From the point of view of the analysis however the factors are treated
symmetrically. In FACTS we have adopted the neutral term "factor" to
avoid the impression that these designs can only apply to doses and dosing regimens.

FACTS then shows all the potential combinations of column and row
factors in the list "Select doses to be used in trial" in which the user
selects which of the factor combinations that will be present as arms in
the trial. FACTS constructs the "effective strengths" opf the
combinations by simply adding together the strengths of the two factors,
but while the strengths of the factors (like the strengths of "doses" in
the 1D setting) cannot be simply changed (because of the problems of
managing the ordering of the factors), strengths of combinations can be
directly edited, and indeed must be edited to resolve any "ties". All
combinations must have unique strengths so that they can be ranked in
order.

If a control treatment arm is included in the trial then a "Control"
factor is included in the Column factors and the user selects which
combination of this factor and a Row factor is the Control combination.
This combination is given the effective strength 0 and moved to the head
of the list of doses. If the "include a control treatment arm" option is
checked, there must be a combination that acts as control dose. If the
option is not checked there will be no control dose.

FACTS displays the resulting ordered list of combinations in the "Doses
in trial" column.

There is also a "Show grid" option that will display a small graphic of
the 2D layout of these "Doses in trial":

![The dosing grid for a 2D dosing model with 2 row factor levels and 4 column factor levels.](../coreUGattachments/continuous/media/image19.png){#fig-2ddosingc}


# Endpoints

The Endpoint sub-tab allows the user to specify the nature of each
endpoint, the target characteristics, and a utility function that allows
the estimate of the response on the different endpoints to be combined
into an overall utility.

## Create Endpoints

The small table on the middle-left side of the screen allows for the creation
of up to 4 endpoints. The name of each of the endpoints can be changed in the
table by clicking on the entry. The order of the non-first endpoints can be
changed by clicking on an endpoint and then clicking on the up or down arrows
to the right of the table.

![The Treatments tab with the first endpoint (U1: Pain) selected.](../coreUGattachments/multendpt/media/image19.png){#fig-endpointsme}

For each endpoint, the Endpoint Properties section allows for the endpoint
specific characteristics to be supplied.

## Endpoint Properties

### Continuous Endpoints

For continuous endpoints, the first value provided is whether a higher response is subject
improvement, or if a lower response is subject improvement.

Then, you select whether to simulate a baseline value for subjects. If yes, then
specify whether the VSR (Virtual Subject Response) will be specified as a change
from the baseline value or as a standalone final endpoint value.

Next, specify whether to use longitudinal modeling for this endpoint. If the
"Use longitudinal Modeling" option is checked, then select one or more visits
that subjects will observe this endpoint at. If not using longitudinal modeling,
then select which visit is considered the final observed value for this endpoint.
Each endpoint can have its own visit schedule, as long as those visits are
included as part of the overall visit schedule on the Study Info tab.

### Dichotomous Endpoints

For dichotomous endpoints, the first value provided is whether an observed response is
a positive outcome or a negative outcome.

Next, specify whether to use longitudinal modeling for this endpoint. If the
"Use longitudinal Modeling" option is checked, then the user can decide if they
would like to use the [restricted markov model](../vsr/dichotomous.qmd#explicitly-defined-restricted-markov-model) to simulate longitudinal data or the
[standard transition matrix method](../vsr/dichotomous.qmd#longitudinal).
If using the restricted Markov model, specify
whether subjects that reach the end of their follow-up without going to either
absorbing states should be considered a success or a failure. Then, select one or more visits
that subjects will observe this endpoint at.

If not using longitudinal modeling, select which visit is considered the
final observed value for this endpoint. Each endpoint can have its own
visit schedule, as long as those visits are included as part of the
overall visit schedule on the Study Info tab.

### Utility Function

The Multiple Endpoint design engine allows clinical trials to be
designed and simulated where the within-trial and end-of-trial decisions
can be based on multiple endpoints by using a composite score, or utility,
derived by combining the different endpoint estimates. The utility
function approach is incredibly open-ended and flexible, able to cope
with different types of endpoints, different endpoint scales and
different endpoint interrelations.

The utility function approach has two stages:

1.  First, each endpoint is converted to its own utility score for each dose.

2.  Then, the endpoint specific utilities are combined into a single overall utility for each dose.

Each endpoint has its own utility function, as described above. Utilities
are flexible piecewise functions of the estimated response for the endpoint.

First use the "Add" button to add the knots of the utility
function -- these are the segment boundaries in the range of the
endpoint measure where different functions will be specified in
each segment. For each segment created by adding a "knot" a row is created in
the table, allowing the user to specify the coefficients of the
utility function in that segment specifically.

The components of the utility that can be weighted based on their coefficients
are: fixed, linear, quadratic, exponential, and log terms.

The coefficients that can be specified are:

-   Alpha: the coefficient of the quadratic term

-   Beta: the coefficient of the linear term

-   Gamma: the coefficient of the fixed term

-   Delta: the coefficient of the exponential term

-   Epsilon: the coefficient of x in the exponential term

-   Phi: the coefficient of the log term

-   Psi: the coefficient of x in the log term

Finally, the user specified whether the $x$ in the utility function is relative
to control or not. If the "Parameterize response relative to control" is checked,
then $x=\theta_d - \theta_0$ for a continuous endpoint, and $x = P_d - P_0$ for
a dichotomous endpoint. If the "Parameterize response relative to control" is checked,
then $x=\theta_d$ for a continuous endpoint and $x=P_d$ for a dichtomous endpoint.

For a continuous endpoint, the utility function is defined on the range of $x \in (-\infty, \infty)$. For dichotomous endpoints, if $x$ is relative to control, then the utility is on the range $x \in (-1, 1)$, and
if $x$ is not relative to control, then the utility is on the range $x \in (0, 1)$.

:::{.callout-note}

### Note on the coefficients of the utility function

It is not the intention that all, or even most, of the available coefficients
are used in any one segment, typically only one or two are.
The different terms are provided so that the required form can be
selected for each segment -- flat linear, quadratic, exponential or
log. The default values of the coefficients are set so that only the linear
component of the utility contributes.

### Estimation of Utility in FACTS

An important aspect of the way FACTS estimates utility is that it
estimates a probability density for the utility within the MCMC
sampling. That is, the utility is calculated for every parameter
sample within the MCMC, and the final distribution of the utility
is based on those samples just like the estimates for the model
parameters.

Each dose has a distribution of utility scores - not a single value.
The utility is not estimated from the mean estimates of the dose
response from the different endpoints.

This has some notable effects on the estimates of utility. If, for
example, the utility function is a step function -- for example if its
value is 1 for response rates below a threshold and 0 above -- as the
estimate of the response rate will have some uncertainty then when the
mean response estimates are around the threshold value, the estimate of
utility will be between 0 and 1, based on the proportion of MCMC samples
the fitted response rate was below the threshold. Indeed, the utility
can be interpreted as the 'probability the response rate is below the
threshold', and thus be useful or even exactly what is required.

Similarly, any utility function that has a floor or ceiling will result
in a bias in the estimate of the utility to be above the floor or below
the ceiling. -- because in the distribution of the values for the
utility the lowest the value can be is the floor and the final estimate
of the utility would only be at the floor if all the values for the
utility sampled in the MCMC were at the floor. Another effect of
utilities with a floor or ceiling is that the estimate of the mean
utility has a smaller standard error the further the value of the
estimate of the mean of the underlying response is from an inflexion
point (or "knot").

These are not errors, nor does it mean utility functions with steps,
ceilings or floors should be avoided, but these artefacts need to be
understood -- particularly when graphs of the estimated utility and the
true utility are compared.

:::{.callout-warning}

### Note about FACTS's utilities

FACTS' utility is based on the estimates of the response on
each endpoint in each treatment arm. It is **not** the utility of
outcome for each individual that would be a composite score and an
endpoint in itself. To use that kind of utility, simulate the
external subjects and their scores outside of FACTS using a program
or script and calculate the composite score for each individual and
write the results to a file in FACTS external virtual subject
response format, this can then be used to drive simulations in FACTS
of trial designs using that composite score. This might be a single
endpoint (FACTS Core Continuous) design, or a Multiple Endpoint
design, with the Composite score as the primary endpoint and up to 3
of the component scores as auxiliary endpoints.

In this latter case, the design would probably be making decisions
based solely on the composite score (so the utility based criteria
are unused), and FACTS Multiple Endpoint's result summarization and
charting is used to understand how when different responses are
simulated on the component scores this translates into the composite
score and the likely trial results.

### Calculation of Arms' probability of having the greatest utility

Like other probabilities in FACTS this is calculated during the MCMC
sampling -- the probability that an arm has the greatest probability is
based on the proportion of MCMC samples when that arm had the greatest
utility. It is not estimated from the utility of the mean estimates of
the dose response for the different endpoints.

In any given sample if several arms have the same maximum toxicity, the
arm with the lowest dose strength is selected. This is particularly
useful when using dose response models with plateau features (the
Plateau and U-shaped models). It means that where the utility is driven
by this model, the arm that will be ranked most likely to have the
greatest utility will be the one that lies at the start of the flat
maximum response section. However it has a less desirable effect when
the overall utility is formed by multiplying the utilities of individual
endpoints and one of the endpoint utility functions has a segment where
the utility is 0.

## Component Utility Combination Method

In order to derive the overall utility score for a dose we first need to
decide how the different utilities are to be used how they are to be
combined.

At the top of the Endpoint tab is a control that is displayed regardless
of which endpoint is being specified. It allows the formula to be
selected that defines the values of the individual utility scores for
each endpoint are to be combined to form the overall utility. The only
operators supported are addition and multiplication, but all logically
distinct combinations (given that the user can re-order the auxiliary
endpoints) are provided:

![All combinations of endpoint specific utilities into the overall utility.](../coreUGattachments/multendpt/media/image21.png){#fig-utilcombination}

:::{.callout-tip}

### Guide for Utility Combination

Utilities can be combined by multiplying them together or adding
together, so when there are just two endpoints there are just two
methods of combination: U1 + U2 and U1 \* U2. With more endpoints there
are more possible combinations. These allow utilities to be formed for a
number of circumstances:

1.  One efficacy and one safety/tolerability endpoint, **U1 \* U2**. Here
    the purpose of the combination is to scale back the efficacy score
    if there are safety or tolerability issues. At its simplest, the
    utility function of the safety / tolerability endpoint is defined so
    that the estimate of the probability of an adverse event or lack of
    tolerability is transformed to so the utility is 0 where the safety
    / tolerability is completely unacceptable, and 1 where it is
    completely acceptable, with possibly a transition region in between.
    The utility of the efficacy endpoint could be simply the value of
    the efficacy endpoint.

    This is not intended to replace SAE monitoring and the withdrawal of
    treatments arms that are unsafe, the safety monitoring may be for
    indicators of potential safety problems when the drug is taken for a
    longer duration than can be studied, or it may be for tolerability
    issues that would give compliance problems, or acceptability problems
    given the other treatments available.

    Some possible variants are: where current treatments have a level of
    unpleasant side effects, the utility of the probability of a side
    effect for our drug may be \>1 for side effect rates below this. The
    utility of the efficacy outcome may be 0 below a certain floor
    efficacy and capped at a maximum above a ceiling efficacy, perhaps to
    stop undue weight being given to an outcome that this thought
    unfeasible or avoid a level of utility on the efficacy score that
    would yield an overall utility that would be judged viable at a poor
    (but not utility 0) level of safety / tolerability.

2.  Two efficacy endpoints, **U1 + U2**. Here the purpose of the combination
    is to allow success if either the response on either endpoint is
    very good, or is quite good on both endpoints. Some care will be
    required to define the utility functions of the endpoints so that
    different combinations of efficacy correctly yield sufficient
    utility or insufficient utility.

3.  An efficacy endpoint and a 'necessary but not sufficient' biomarker,
    **U1 \* U2**. Here the purpose of the combination is to yield an overall
    utility of 0 if the biomarker is not observed at the necessary
    levels, otherwise the utility is driven by the primary endpoint that
    is observed much later. This allows early stopping for futility, arm
    dropping, or adaptive allocation away from arms with poor levels of
    biomarker, but for success to be determined only on the basis of the
    primary endpoint.

Utilities with more than two endpoints are usually some form of
combination of the above, for example a primary secondary and secondary
endpoint and a safety/tolerability endpoint: **(U1 + U2) \* U3**.

:::

Devising and agreeing upon utility functions with a clinical team is part art
and part science (and possibly, part politics). Some have expressed the
opinion that these methods could never be used in practice because it
would be impossible to get agreement, but experience shows agreement is
possible. Generally, the process followed is roughly as follows:

-   The team agrees how the endpoints will be combined and specifies
    some key utility points -- at specific combinations of response at
    the different endpoints -- for example:

    - If there were no observed side effects, what is the minimum
      level of efficacy that would be a useful drug?

    - If the maximum expected level of efficacy was observed, what is
      the maximum level of side effects that could be observed that
      would leave a useful drug

    - See “Dose-Finding Based On Efficacy-Toxicity Trade-Offs” by @ThallCook2004, for a description of such an elicitation process.

- The statistician creates utility functions for the endpoints that
    yield the desired overall utility value at the specified points.

- Using FACTS some simple trials are simulated and example simulated
    datasets and analyses are studied and reviewed with the team. The
    team is asked the question "Given the data that was simulated, (and
    the distributions they were simulated from) what do they think of
    the utility assigned to the treatment arms?"

- The statistician adjusts the utility functions and iterates the
    process of simulating and reviewing with the team.

- Once the team is happy with individual examples of how utility is
    assigned, a larger number of simulations can be run and the
    estimates of the operating characteristics considered and other
    aspects of the trials design considered.


### Estimation of Utility in FACTS

An important aspect of the way FACTS estimates utility is that it
estimates a probability density for the utility within the MCMC
sampling. That is, the utility is calculated for every parameter
sample within the MCMC, and the final distribution of the utility
is based on those samples just like the estimates for the model
parameters.

Each dose has a distribution of utility scores - not a single value.
The utility is not estimated from the mean estimates of the dose
response from the different endpoints.

This has some notable effects on the estimates of utility. If, for
example, the utility function is a step function -- for example if its
value is 1 for response rates below a threshold and 0 above -- as the
estimate of the response rate will have some uncertainty then when the
mean response estimates are around the threshold value, the estimate of
utility will be between 0 and 1, based on the proportion of MCMC samples
the fitted response rate was below the threshold. Indeed, the utility
can be interpreted as the 'probability the response rate is below the
threshold', and thus be useful or even exactly what is required.

Similarly, any utility function that has a floor or ceiling will result
in a bias in the estimate of the utility to be above the floor or below
the ceiling. -- because in the distribution of the values for the
utility the lowest the value can be is the floor and the final estimate
of the utility would only be at the floor if all the values for the
utility sampled in the MCMC were at the floor. Another effect of
utilities with a floor or ceiling is that the estimate of the mean
utility has a smaller standard error the further the value of the
estimate of the mean of the underlying response is from an inflexion
point (or "knot").

These are not errors, nor does it mean utility functions with steps,
ceilings or floors should be avoided, but these artefacts need to be
understood -- particularly when graphs of the estimated utility and the
true utility are compared.

### Calculation of Arms' probability of having the greatest utility

Like other probabilities in FACTS this is calculated during the MCMC
sampling -- the probability that an arm has the greatest probability is
based on the proportion of MCMC samples when that arm had the greatest
utility. It is not estimated from the utility of the mean estimates of
the dose response for the different endpoints.

In any given sample if several arms have the same maximum toxicity, the
arm with the lowest dose strength is selected. This is particularly
useful when using dose response models with plateau features (the
Plateau and U-shaped models). It means that where the utility is driven
by this model, the arm that will be ranked most likely to have the
greatest utility will be the one that lies at the start of the flat
maximum response section. However it has a less desirable effect when
the overall utility is formed by multiplying the utilities of individual
endpoints and one of the endpoint utility functions has a segment where
the utility is 0.

:::{.callout-caution}

### Caution when using 0 in your utilities

Having segments of utility 0 for an endpoint, and
calculating the overall utility by multiplying the component
utilities will lead to segments of 0 in the overall utility. If in
only a proportion of the MCMC samples all arms have a utility of 0,
this will result in that proportion of the probability of being the
arm with the maximum utility being placed on the arm with the lowest
dose strength, which might be odd given the utility in the other
samples. It can lead to counter intuitive and sometimes undesired
adaptations, such as in the adaptive allocation of subjects between
the arms.

**The solution is to not use 0** for the segments of low utility, but
a small value such as 0.01, the multiplication with the utility of
the other endpoints will then not flatten them all to exactly 0, but
retain the utility profile at attenuated values.

# Variants

On this tab the user can specify that a number of design variants should
be created. Currently, the only design feature that can be changed is the
sample size (maximum number of subjects).

If "multiple variants" is checked, then the user can specify that
simulations setups should be created for each simulation scenario with
versions of the design with a different maximum number of subjects.

The user enters the number of variants they wish to create. Then in the
resulting table, enter different "Maximum Subjects" for each variant. On
the simulations tab FACTS will then create a copy of all the scenarios
to run with each variant.
