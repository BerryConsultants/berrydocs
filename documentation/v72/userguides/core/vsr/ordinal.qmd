In FACTS Core with an ordinal endpoint there are 2 different
ways to specify the virtual subject response:

1.  Explicit specification of all outcome probabilities

2.  Explicit specification of outcome probabilities for the control arm, plus an odds ratio for each other arm that defines a proportional odds treatment effect deviation from the control probabilities.  


# Explicitly Defined Ordinal Response

Explicitly defined VSRs are the most common type specified in FACTS. In
dichotomous endpoint designs, an explicitly defined VSR is specified by providing
a response rate for each arm in the trial. The dichotomous final outcome will
be simulated having the desired response rate, and longitudinal correlation can
be simulated connecting subjects' intermediate endpoints to the final endpoint.

## Dose Response

<!--- ![The Explicitly Defined > Dose Response model for an ordinal endpoint.](../coreUGattachments/dichotomous/media/image20.png){#fig-expdrd} --->

Dose response profiles can be added and deleted.  For each profile the user may use either of these specifications: 

1.  The outcome probabilities for each treatment arm (if "Use proportional odds" is unchecked).  FACTS allows the user to supply unnormalized probabilities (for example, counts) and will convert the input into a vector of probabilities that sum to one.  

2.  The outcome probabilities for the control arm (which can be entered unnormalized), and an odds ratio for each other arm.  If the normalized probabilities for the control arm are denoted by 
$(p^0_1,p^0_2,\ldots,p^0_K)$ and the odds ratio for the $d^{th}$ arm is $\exp(\theta_d)$, then the probabilities for the $d^{th}$ arm are given by 
$$\mbox{logit}\left(\sum_{j=1}^k p^d_j\right)=\mbox{logit}\left(\sum_{j=1}^k p^0_j\right) - \theta_d$$
for $k=1,2,\ldots,K-1$.  


In addition, FACTS provides a check box that allows the user to specify whether a specific arm
    "should succeed" in that scenario: so that FACTS can report on the
    proportion of simulations that were successful **and** a 'good'
    treatment arm selected.

#### Load Scenario Outcome Data From File

If the "Load scenario outcome data from file" option is selected then in
scenarios using this profile the simulations will use a range of dose
responses. Each individual simulation uses one set of outcome probabilities
from the supplied file, each row being used in an equal number of
simulations. The summary results are thus averaged over all the VSRs in
the file. The use of this form of simulation is somewhat different from
simulations using a single rate or single external virtual subject
response file. When all the simulations are simulated from one 'truth'
then the purpose of the simulations is to analyse the performance of the
design under that specific circumstance. When the simulations are based
on a range of 'truths' then the summary results show the expected
probability of the different outcomes for the trial over that range of
possible circumstances. Note that to give different VSRs different
weights of expectation, the more likely VSRs should be repeated within
the file.

After selecting the ".mvsr" file the graph shows the individual response
rates and the mean response rate over all the VSRs.

The format of the ".mvsr" file is a simple CSV text file. Lines starting
with a '#' character are ignored, so the file can include comment and
header lines. There must be one column per treatment arm, and they must
be in dose index order. Each value is the underlying response rate to
simulate. E.g.:

```
#Cntrl, D1, D2, D3, D4
0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.25, 0.5
0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.23, 0.45
0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.21, 0.4
0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.19, 0.35
0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.17, 0.3
0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.15, 0.25
```
