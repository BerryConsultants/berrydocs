# Introduction

FACTS 8.1.0 is now available for download via [FACTS Cloud](https://factscloud-live.azurewebsites.net/). Its main new features are:

- Two new Quick Starts to facilitate the creation of Promising Zone and Goldilocks designs.

# FACTS Core and Staged Improvements

- In Core and Staged designs, the "QOIs per Interim" scenario results graph will now display the number of outcome types at each interim (success, futility, inconclusice, etc.) as well as the number of simulations that have reached the given interim. 
- In Core and Staged designs, the "QOIs per Interim" scenario results graph will now handle the display of simulations with flip-flop outcomes (Success->Futility, Futility->Success) correctly.
- In Staged designs, the "QOIs per Interim" scenario results graph will correctly handle the display of early/late graduation from Stage 1 to Stage 2 outcomes.
- In Staged designs, the "Per Sim: Interim Info" scenario results graph will correctly handle the display of simulations which have stopped in Stage 1.
- In Staged designs, the complete data analysis (CDA) Stage 1 summary file will now correctly match header columns with the underlying data.

# FACTS Enrichment Design Improvements

# FACTS Platform Trial Improvements

- In Platform Trial designs, the "QOIs per Update" scenario results graph will now display the number of outcome types at each interim (success, futility, inconclusice, etc.) as well as the number of simulations that have reached the given update.
- In Platform Trial designs, the "QOIs per Update" scenario results graph will now handle the display of simulations with flip-flop outcomes (Success->Futility, Futility->Success) and "late" outcomes (Late Success, Late Futility, Inconclusive) correctly.
- In Platform Trial designs, changing a non-default QOI to a default QOI (when the referenced QOI is used in stopping criteria) will no longer result in simulation errors.

# FACTS Dose Escalation Improvements

# General Improvements

- The runtime memory usage of FACTS has been improved significantly. In particular, the number of Graphic Device Interface (GDI) objects used by FACTS has been reduced significantly when opening multiple designs with the same instance of FACTS.
- Cancelling simulations when there are existing scenarios that have been successfully simulated will no longer result in the "Across Scenario" graph popping up erroneously multiple times.
