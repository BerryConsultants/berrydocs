# Introduction

FACTS 8.1.0 is now available for download via [FACTS Cloud](https://factscloud-live.azurewebsites.net/). Its main new features are:

- Two new Quick Starts to facilitate the creation of Promising Zone and Goldilocks designs.
- Seamless Phase 2/3 ("Staged") designs using ordinal endpoints.
- In Group Sequential Quick Starts, the ability to specify binding/non-binding futility rules.
- New operational QOIs tracking the trial status and additional comparison operators to facilitate their usage.

# FACTS Core and Staged Improvements

- In Core and Staged designs, users can now create operational QOIs tracking the trial status, and use these as part of decision rules. The trial status operational QOIs include: whether the trial is still accruing participants, whether the trial has reached the max sample size, whether the trial has stopped early for success/futility/graduation, and the interim number of early stopping.
- In Core and Staged designs, additional comparison operators when comparing QOIs against threshold values have been added. Users can now use the following comparison operators: '<', '<=', '=', '>=', '>'.    
- In Core and Staged designs, the creation of a new Posterior Probability QOI, Predictive Probability QOI, p-value QOI and Operational QOI will now automatically create a corresponding Decision QOI evaluated at a sensible default target.    
- In Core and Staged designs, the "QOIs per Interim" scenario results graph will now display the number of outcome types at each interim (success, futility, inconclusice, etc.) as well as the number of simulations that have reached the given interim. 
- In Core and Staged designs, the "QOIs per Interim" scenario results graph will now handle the display of simulations with flip-flop outcomes (Success->Futility, Futility->Success) correctly.
- In Core and Staged designs, the "Per Sim: Interim Info" scenario results graph will correctly extend the subject information plots (enrolled, completers, dropouts, etc.) to the final analysis when the trial has stopped early but has follow-up.
- In Core and Staged designs, existing design loaded into FACTS with an invalid setting for the dose response model 'Model Control Separately' parameter will be rectified upon load.
- In Core Multiple Endpoint designs, loading an existing design and adding default QOIs to it will no longer result in FACTS erroring upon simulation.
- In Staged designs, the "QOIs per Interim" scenario results graph will correctly handle the display of early/late graduation from Stage 1 to Stage 2 outcomes.
- In Staged designs, the "Per Sim: Interim Info" scenario results graph will correctly handle the display of simulations which have stopped in Stage 1.
- In Staged designs, the complete data analysis (CDA) Stage 1 summary file will now correctly match header columns with the underlying data.
- In Staged designs, a new "Outcome" results summary graph is available across all scenarios and within the "Overall" graphing section of a given scenario. This graphs displays the proportion of all outcomes that have occurred across the entire trial, broken down by stage.
- In Staged designs, timed interims in the second stage will now be handled more robustly, ensuring that stage 2 interims will not “back up” to a stage 1 time for initial analysis.

# FACTS Enrichment Design Improvements

# FACTS Platform Trial Improvements

- In Platform Trial designs, the "QOIs per Update" scenario results graph will now display the number of outcome types at each interim (success, futility, inconclusice, etc.) as well as the number of simulations that have reached the given update.
- In Platform Trial designs, the "QOIs per Update" and "Per Sim: Interim Info" scenario results graph will now handle the display of simulations with flip-flop outcomes (Success->Futility, Futility->Success, Success->Inconclusive, Futility->Inconclusive) and "late" outcomes (Late Success, Late Futility, Inconclusive) correctly.
- In Platform Trial designs, changing a non-default QOI to a default QOI (when the referenced QOI is used in stopping criteria) will no longer result in simulation errors.
- In Platform Trial designs, additional comparison operators when comparing QOIs against threshold values have been added. Users can now use the following comparison operators: '<', '<=', '=', '>=', '>'. 

# FACTS Dose Escalation Improvements

- In CRM designs, when both the MED and MTD are estimated to be above the investigated dose range, the selected OSD is now -1, i.e. none of the investigated doses is selected as OSD.
- In 2D-CRM designs, running an analysis via the Analysis tab for a design using a custom run-in will now output the correct dose recommendations.

# General Improvements

- The runtime memory usage of FACTS has been improved significantly. In particular, the number of Graphic Device Interface (GDI) objects used by FACTS has been reduced significantly when opening multiple designs with the same instance of FACTS.
- Cancelling simulations when there are existing scenarios that have been successfully simulated will no longer result in the "Across Scenario" graph popping up erroneously multiple times.
- The time taken to generate simulation scenarios when creating new simulation profiles has been improved. This becomes particularly noticeable when the design contains a large number of simulations scenarios, some of which have been already simulated. 
- If crash/analytics data sharing is enabled (Settings > Options > Analytics), the shared data will contain the user's organization name in order to improve user experience.
