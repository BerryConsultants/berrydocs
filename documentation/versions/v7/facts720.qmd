# Introduction

FACTS 7.2.0 is now available for download via [FACTS Cloud](https://factscloud-live.azurewebsites.net/). FACTS users can now:

-	Create simple operational QOIs that can be used to make decisions.
- Create BOIN, mTPI, mTPI-2, i3+3 and 3+3 dose escalation designs within the same user interface. 


# FACTS Core and Staged Improvements

-	In Staged designs, the "Mirror Stage 1 Longitudinal Model in Stage 2" on the Design > Longitudinal tab will be fully visible.
- In Core and Staged designs, designs created with FACTS 6.1 or older and loaded in FACTS 7.2 will now correctly generate frequentist output files for backward compatibility.
- FACTS will now correctly handling the display of QOI simulation results when loading an existing Core Multiple Endpoint design.
- In Staged design, Stage 2 adaptive allocation now defaults to all treatments except Treatment 1 as adaptive.
- In non-adaptive Core and Staged designs, FACTS will now correctly report the fixed randomization probabilities.  

# FACTS Enrichment Design Improvements

-  In Time-to-Event designs, the VSR, Group Response Hazard ratio default values were changed from 0.9 to 1.0.

# FACTS Platform Trial Improvements

# FACTS Dose Escalation Improvements

- In mTPI designs, cohort expansion columns present in the summary file will now be displayed as "-9999" (the N/A code) instead of empty or "0" entries when the underlying design does not have cohort expansion enabled.
- In mTPI designs, packetised simulations will now correctly display the simulation number in the resulting simulations.csv file, instead of showing duplicate simulation numbers. 
- In mTPI designs, the final selected MTD is now reported correctly in all instances.

# General Improvements

- FACTS will no longer display a warning message for using the "Legacy Adaptation" allocation option when the underlying design does not make use of adaptive features.
- FACTS will no longer mark a simulated scenario as having errored when simulations have completed successfully but the associated temporary "pkt" simulation folders where each simulation packet is run have failed to be deleted. This can typically arise when simulating a FACTS design saced in a shared drive.
-	FACTS designs simulated using a self hosted HPC grid will now be handled in a more user-friendly way; by first checking if the HPC grid URL is correct, and by only reporting grid submission failures once all simulations have been processed to prevent job submission processing from being blocked [Enterprise licensees only].
- FACTS designs simulated on a shared/remote drive such as OneDrive will be handled more robustly.
