## 2025

We are excited to announce that we are currently working on:

- FACTS Core Ordinal Endpoint

- FACTS Dose Escalation: i3+3, mTPI-2 and BOIN

- New Response Adaptive Allocation options

- Greater flexibility in adaptive decisions (e.g. being able to combine different QOIs in an AND/OR logic, but also many more)

- Quick Start options to enter standard design types (such as widley used group sequential designs)

If you have any questions, suggestions or requests, please [contact us](../../contact/index.qmd).
