The Virtual Subject Response tab allows the user to explicitly define
virtual subject response profiles, and/or to import virtual subject
response from externally simulated PK/PD data. When simulations are
executed, they will be executed for each profile specified by the user.

## Explicitly Defined

### Group Response

Response profiles may be added, deleted, and renamed using the table and
corresponding buttons on the left hand side of the screen in @fig-fig22
Response rate values are entered for the treatment and control arms (if
present) for each group directly into the Treatment Response Rate and
Control Response Rate columns of the table. The graphical representation
of these values updates accordingly.

In addition it is possible for the user to specify if a group “Should
Succeed” using the “Should succeed” checkbox on each row. This is then
used in the summary of the simulation results to compute how often the
simulated trial was successful and groups that ‘Should Succeed’ were
successful (reported in the column “Ppn Correct Groups”) and how often
the simulated trial was successful and groups that were not marked
‘Should Succeed’ were successful (reported in the column “Ppn Incorrect
Groups”).

The graph that shows the response defined – as with all graphs in the
application – may be easily copied using the ‘Copy Graph’ option in the
context menu accessed by right-clicking on the graph. The user is given
the option to copy the graph to their clipboard (for easy pasting into
other applications, such as Microsoft Word or PowerPoint), or to save
the graph as an image file.

### Load Scenario Responses From File

If the “Load scenario means from a file” option is selected then in
scenarios using this profile the simulations will use a range of dose
responses.

Each individual simulation uses one set of responses from the supplied
file, each row being used in an equal number of simulations. The summary
results are thus averaged over all the VSRs in the file. The use of this
form of simulation is somewhat different from simulations using a single
rate or single external virtual subject response file. When all the
simulations are simulated from a single version of the ‘truth’ then the
purpose of the simulations is to analyse the performance of the design
under that specific circumstance. When the simulations are based on a
range of ‘truths’ loaded from an ‘.mvsr’ file then the summary results
show the expected probability of the different outcomes for the trial
over that range of possible circumstances. Note that to give different
VSRs different weights of expectation, the more likely VSRs should be
repeated within the file.

![Virtual Subject Response - Loading scenario group response rates from an external file.](../EDDich/media/image23.png){#fig-fig23}

After selecting the “.mvsr” file the graph shows the individual mean
responses and the overall mean response over all the VSRs.

The format of the file is a simple CSV text file. Lines starting with a
‘#’ character are ignored so the file can include comment and header
lines. In the normal case the format is:

- If a control arm is being used: Each line should contain columns
  \[PT<sub>1</sub>, PT<sub>2</sub>, … , PT<sub>G</sub>, PC<sub>G</sub>,
  PC<sub>1</sub>, PC<sub>2</sub>, … , PC<sub>G</sub>\] giving the true
  mean response probabilities (PT<sub>i</sub>) for the Treatment arm in
  each of the G groups, followed by the analogous parameters for the
  Control arms.

- Without a control arm, using Objective Control: Each line should
  contain columns \[PT<sub>1</sub>, PT<sub>2</sub>, … , PT<sub>G</sub>\]
  giving the true mean response probabilities (PT<sub>i</sub>) for the
  Treatment arm in each of the G groups.

When using the Restricted Markov Model the format is:

- If a control arm is being used: Each line should contain columns
  \[P1T<sub>1</sub>, P1T<sub>2</sub>, … , P1T<sub>G</sub>,
  P0T<sub>1</sub>, P0T<sub>2</sub>, … , P0T<sub>G</sub>,
  P1C<sub>1</sub>, P1C<sub>2</sub>, … , P1C<sub>G</sub>,
  P0C<sub>1</sub>, P0C<sub>2</sub>, … , P0C<sub>G</sub>\] giving the
  true mean response probabilities (P1T<sub>i</sub>) and true mean
  non-response probabilities (P0T<sub>i</sub>) for the Treatment arm in
  each of the G groups, followed by the analogous parameters for the
  Control arms.

- Without a control arm, using Objective Control: Each line should
  contain columns \[P1T<sub>1</sub>, P1T<sub>2</sub>, … ,
  P1T<sub>G</sub>, P0T<sub>1</sub>, P0T<sub>2</sub>, … ,
  P0T<sub>G</sub>\] giving the true mean response probabilities
  (P1T<sub>i</sub>) and true mean non-response probabilities
  (P0T<sub>i</sub>) for the Treatment arm in each of the G groups.

```

## Longitudinal Models

If ‘Use longitudinal modeling’ has been checked on the [‘Study Info’ tab](../study/dichotomous.qmd),
and explicitly defined group responses have been specified, then it will
be necessary to specify how to simulate the subjects’ responses at
intermediate visits. This is done by specifying a transition method that
can be combined with any of the response profiles to generate the
intermediate results for subjects on treatment or control in all the
groups.

The methods are parameterized so that its inclusion does not affect the
response rate of the final endpoint to be simulated, and they scale
automatically to suit each group response profile.

[Click here](../../core/longitudinalmodels/dichotomous.qmd) for an overview of longitudinal models for dichotomous endpoints in the FACTS Core engine. 

### Enter / Retain Method

The Enter/Retain method is parameterized by setting probabilities for
transition from non-responder to responder, and for remaining a
responder once observed for each visit.

![Simulated Longitudinal Results – enter/retain method.](../EDDich/media/image24.png){#fig-fig24}

The transition probabilities will be modified for each treatment arm in
each group response profile, to preserve the specified rate of response
to simulate. This is done by finding (using numerical iteration) for
each response rate to be simulated, the offset which, when added to the
log odds of the all the transition probabilities, results in transition
probabilities that give the required response rate.

### Restricted Markov Model

If the restricted Markov model was selected on the Study Info tab, the
subject simulation method is fully described by the overall probability
of response and failure for each group.

![Simulated subject response - restricted Markov method.](../EDDich/media/image25.png){#fig-fig25}

For each group, a final probability of response and failure are
specified. The Probability of final stability is then inferred as the
probability that neither response nor failure is observed. The response
and failure rate can then be calculated as:

$$
\lambda_{r} = \frac{\Pr(resp)\left\lbrack - \ln{\Pr(stable)} \right\rbrack}{\nu_{T}\left( 1 - Pr(stable) \right)}
$$

$$
\lambda_{f} = \frac{\Pr(fail)\left\lbrack - \ln{\Pr(stable)} \right\rbrack}{\nu_{T}\left( 1 - Pr(stable) \right)}
$$

where $\nu_{T}$ is the time of the final visit. When a virtual subject
is recruited into the trial, a response and failure time are simulated
based on the response and failure rates. If both events (response and
failure) occur after the final visit, the simulated subject is counted
as a final stability and their outcome is based on whether final
stabilities count as success or failure as specified on the Study \>
Study Info tab. If one or both events occur before the final visit, the
event that occurred first is taken as the subject’s final response
because this is an absorbing state model. Once an outcome has been
observed, that outcome remains for the rest of the treatment schedule.

If values are entered for the probability of response and failure that
sum to greater than one, the probability of stability displays an error
and the response rates are reported as NaN (not a number).

If values are entered for the probability of response and failure that
sum to exactly one, the probability of stability is 0 and both response
rates are effectively infinite. In this case, “\*\*” is displayed as the
response rate although these are valid settings.

## External

As well as simulating subject response within FACTS they can be
simulated externally, from a PK-PD model for instance, and imported into
FACTS, and the supplied responses are sampled from (with replacement) to
provide the subject responses in the simulation. The specification of a
file containing subject response data (which must be in the required
format) can be done from the External Files sub-tab depicted below.

To import an external file, the user must first add a profile to the
table. After adding the profile, a file selector window is opened and
the user must select the file of externally simulated data. To change
the selection, click the ‘Browse’ button.

![External Data.](../EDDich/media/image26.png){#fig-fig26}


### Required Format of Externally Simulated Data

The supplied data should be in the following format: an ascii file with
data in comma separated value format with the following columns:

1.  Patient id (must be positive and change from subject to subject)

2.  Group index (1, 2, 3,… )

3.  Arm Index (1 = Control, 2 = Treatment)

4.  Visit Id (1, 2, 3, …)

5.  Response (0, 1), if the Restricted Markov model is being used then
    possible Response values are (0, 1, -1 = stable).

The GUI requires that the file name has a “.dat” suffix.

The following shows values from an example file. Note that all visits
for each subject must be grouped together. Thus all the data for the
first subject comes before that of the second, and so on.

```
#Patient ID, Group Index, Arm Index, Visit, Response
1, 1, 1, 1, 0
1, 1, 1, 2, 0
1, 1, 1, 3, 1
1, 1, 1, 4, 0
2, 1, 2, 1, 0
2, 1, 2, 2, 0
2, 1, 2, 3, 0
2, 1, 2, 4, 0
3, 2, 1, 1, 0
3, 2, 1, 2, 0
3, 2, 1, 3, 1
3, 2, 1, 4, 1
```

Simulated subjects will be drawn from this supplied list, with
replacement, to provide the simulated response values.
