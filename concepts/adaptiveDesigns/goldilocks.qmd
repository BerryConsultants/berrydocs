## Introduction

Goldilocks designs achieve everything group sequential designs do, but may provide a number of additional advantages. Goldilocks designs are widely used both in “Learn” and “Confirm” studies, the approach is accepted by health authorities, and operating characteristics can be determined through simulation (FACTS). 

A Goldilocks trial design is an adaptive clinical trial methodology developed to optimize the sample size dynamically during the course of a trial. Its name references the "just right" principle from the Goldilocks fairy tale—neither too large nor too small. Goldilocks designs seek balance between flexibility and efficiency, by repeatedly updating sample-size decisions based on accumulating trial data, through predictive probability or other Bayesian statistical methods.

Goldilocks designs allow for stopping the trial early by halting accrual at an interim analysis, but always allow subjects the opportunity to collect complete follow-up before the trial’s final analysis is performed. Goldilocks designs combine the completely observed patient data with the uncertainty associated with the missing data at the time of an interim analysis, and use predictive probabilities to decide if stopping for expected success or futility is appropriate.

This is particularly relevant if the primary endpoint involves a delayed observation. If an interim analysis declares early success, and accrual stops, but more data from patients already randomized come in, and the statistic drops below the threshold, can we claim that we have demonstrated efficacy? Goldilocks designs explicitly take this possibility into account and mitigate the risk of a “flip flop” (i.e. declaring “success” early at an interim analysis, based on incomplete data, only to see this flipping into “no success”) once all data (including delayed observations) become available. 

## Goldilocks Clinical Trial Designs

The Goldilocks trial design, as an adaptive trial framework, draws on the strengths of group sequential designs and additionally emphasizes flexibility, efficiency, and optimal use of data. The concept of the “Goldilocks” design comes from the idea of finding an optimal balance—where the trial is neither too large (wasting resources) nor too small (lacking statistical power), but just right for the research question at hand.

## Key Features of Goldilocks Trial Designs
1.	Adaptive and Flexible: Goldilocks designs allow for multiple adaptive changes based on interim results, such as the addition or removal of treatment arms, changes to patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, or modifications to the statistical model. This flexibility allows the trial to be tailored in real-time to the evolving landscape of treatment options, participant response, and other external factors.
2.	Incorporation of Multiple Interim Analyses: Goldilocks trials can conduct interim analyses at flexible intervals. This enables real-time decision-making that maximizes the use of accumulated data, including incomplete data.

## Key aspects of Goldilocks Designs

#### Bayesian and Predictive Probability Approaches
Goldilocks designs frequently utilize Bayesian methods, commonly including multiple imputation, and predictive probability calculations at interim analyses to assess the likelihood of trial success at any given point, guiding adaptive sample size decisions. Both Goldilocks designs and group sequential designs can have a frequentist final analysis. 

#### Analytical Calculations of Stopping Boundaries
Group sequential designs have analytical calculations that provide stopping boundaries guaranteeing exact Type I error control. It is common to simulate the Type I error of a Goldilocks design to calculate stopping boundaries. 

#### Stopping for futility
Goldilocks designs allow futility stopping criteria to be framed in terms of the predictive probability of success: What would the probability of success be, should the trial continue to recruit up to the full sample size and all follow-up information was collected? If this probability is smaller than some predefined threshold (say for instance less than 5%) the trial can stop for futility. 

## Example Applications and Technical Details

A foundational paper explicitly outlining the "Goldilocks" approach was authored by Broglio, Connor, and Berry (2014) (1). In their seminal work, they introduce a Bayesian predictive probability framework to guide sample size adaptations, clearly illustrating how interim results influence sample-size decisions:
In this paper, Broglio et al. provide detailed simulations and comparisons illustrating how Goldilocks designs can outperform traditional designs, particularly when initial estimates of treatment effects are uncertain. They demonstrate that these designs can substantially reduce the number of patients exposed to ineffective treatments without sacrificing statistical rigor. Tables and figures in the paper present simulations showing how predictive probabilities shift dynamically with accumulating data, and how this influences ongoing sample size decisions.
Goldilocks designs represent a significant advance in clinical trial methodology, providing a mechanism for dynamically adjusting sample size to achieve optimal efficiency and ethical balance. They differ from traditional group sequential designs through continuous or periodic Bayesian predictive adaptation, making them well-suited to modern clinical trial challenges such as uncertain effect sizes, limited patient populations, or time-critical situations like pandemics. By integrating real-time data monitoring with flexible decision-making, Goldilocks designs help ensure trials are appropriately powered without unnecessary resource expenditure or patient exposure to inferior treatments.
