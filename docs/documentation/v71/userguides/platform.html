<p>FACTS Platform Trials is useful for simulating trials in which there are a number of treatments being tested against a common control arm. Unlike in the FACTS Core engine, each of these treatments is meant to stand alone, and decisions are made on individual arms rather than at the trial level. As a result, there is not expected to be a dose-response relationship between the treatments. Two common goals of platform trials are to find many effective treatments among a set of treatments or to find a single effective treatment arm as quickly as possible. Treatments in a platform trial can leave the trial when a decision has been made for that arm or they have reached their sample size cap, and new treatment arms can enter when they are available to begin randomizing.</p>
<p>FACTS V7.0 was the first version of FACTS to feature a Platform Trial simulator.</p>
<p>This first version of the Platform Trial simulator FACTS provides fairly limited options for the statistical analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The endpoint can be Continuous or Dichotomous.</p></li>
<li><p>Treatments are compared to a common control arm - either all randomized controls or concurrent controls only.</p></li>
<li><p>Trial Updates (a.k.a. interim analyses) can be specified in a number of ways: fixed intervals by time, the number of subjects recruited, the number of subjects complete up to a specified visit or the number of subjects who have had the opportunity to complete up to a specified visit.</p></li>
<li><p>Milestones are defined that apply to each treatment arm separately and different decision rules or thresholds can be defined based on which milestones have been reached by the arm.</p></li>
<li><p>Updates can be organized in one of three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Updates occur whenever an arm meets a milestone, and that arm’s appropriate milestone rules are checked.</p></li>
<li><p>Updates occur on a regular basis, and at each update each arm is checked to see if it has passed a new milestone, and if it has, the appropriate milestone rules are checked.</p></li>
<li><p>Updates occur on a regular basis, and the milestone rules are checked for the highest milestone that has been passed. This allows that a particular milestone’s rules are checked repeatedly if updates are frequent.</p></li>

<dl>
<dt>Trial</dt>
<dd>
The Trial Tabs are for entering the main characteristics of the study and specifying the treatment arms to be tested in the study. This is where the user specifies the ‘given’ requirements, or constraints, of the trial to be designed.
</dd>
<dt>Virtual Response</dt>
<dd>
The Virtual Response tabs are for specifying the simulation of subject responses, specifying the mean response for each treatment arm and the dropout rates.
</dd>
<dt>Accrual</dt>
<dd>
The Accrual tab is for specifying the rate of subject accrual.
</dd>
<dt>Quantities of Interest</dt>
<dd>
The Quantities of Interest tabs are for specifying the quantities to be calculated during analyses for output in the results, and possible use in adaptive allocation, early stopping and final evaluation decisions.
</dd>
<dt>Design</dt>
<dd>
The Design tabs are for specifying the statistical analysis to be used. These are the design choices open to the trial biostatistician and can include how to model the final responses, what decisions to take at trial updates and how to make decisions for individual treatment arms. The expected consequences of these design choices are then estimated by running simulations of the trials using the various virtuaresponse profiles defined.
</dd>
<dt>Simulation</dt>
<dd>
On the Simulation tab, the user controls and runs simulations and can view the simulation results.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also on the menu bar, on the right hand side of the FACTS Window, is a button labeled “Notes”; clicking this button reveals a simple “notepad” window in which the user can maintain some simple notes that will be stored within the “.facts” file.</p>

<p>The platform trial will automatically terminate when all of the defined treatments have had a chance to enter the trial and complete their enrollment and follow-up. Arms that attempt to join the platform, but are not allowed to, are considered complete.</p>
<section id="max-enrollment-time-wks" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="max-enrollment-time-wks">Max enrollment time (wks)</h4>

</section>
<section id="max-number-of-participants" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="max-number-of-participants">Max number of participants</h4>
<p>You may limit the total number of subjects that can be enrolled to the platform. If the trial reaches this number of subjects it stops accruing, follows up subjects, and performs a final analysis.</p>

<p>In the current implementation, a control arm is required.</p>
<p>Clicking the “Add” button creates a new active arm. Selecting a row, and clicking “Delete Arm” will remove the selected active arm. Clicking “Clear all arms” will delete all active arms from the table. The arms names can be changed in the table.</p>
<p>Arms are considered independent in the platform trial engine, so Index (d) ordering is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The number of arms defined here determines the maximum number of treatments that can enter the simulated trials. If the simulation does not stop through meeting one of the optional maximums that can be specified on the Trial &gt; Trial Info tab, then it will stop when the last treatment from this list to complete enrollment completes the follow-up of the last patient allocated to it.</p>

<section id="earliestlatest-possible-arrival-wks" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="earliestlatest-possible-arrival-wks">Earliest/Latest Possible Arrival (wks)</h4>
<p>These column specify the range of times (in weeks) that an arm becomes available to enter the trial.

To simulate a trial with an arm that always enters at the exact same time provide the same value for the earliest and latest possible arrivals for the arm.</p>

<section id="withdrawn-if-not-used-within" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="withdrawn-if-not-used-within">Withdrawn If Not Used Within</h4>
<p>This column specifies how long an arm will wait to begin enrolling in the trial before it “gives up” and withdraws from the trial. That is, if the arm becomes available while there are already more active treatment arms than the max concurrent treatments (as specified on the Trial &gt; Trial Info tab), then the arm must wait before being allowed to enter the trial. In that case, if no arm leaves the trial before the end of the waiting period, the waiting arm will withdraw and never enter the trial.</p>
<p>In the case of a tie in arrival times, the lower-indexed arm is entered into the trial first.</p>
<p>To create a trial in which arms never “time out” and withdraw from the study, enter a very large value in the Withdrawn if not used within column.</p>

<h1>Virtual Subject Response</h1>
<p>As with all FACTS design engines the Virtual Subject Response tab allows the user to explicitly define virtual subject response profiles, and/or to import virtual externally simulated patient responses from an exteral file. When simulations are executed, they will be executed for a specific scenario – where a scenario is a combination of one of each type of profile – dose response, longitudinal (not yet implemented), accrual, and dropout.</p>
<p>The VSR tab in the platform trials engine differs from the VSR tab in the Core engines in a few ways. The biggest changes are the treatment classification method and that treatment efficacies can be simulated from distributions in the platform trials engine.</p>
<section id="treatment-classification" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="treatment-classification">Treatment Classification</h2>
<p>Many outputs and graphs depend on a classification of the treatment effect as “good,” “mediocre,” or “unacceptable.” The thresholds provided on this tab are used in this classification. These treatment effect thresholds are applied to the true effect size for the simulation. For fixed effects, a treatment arm will be categorized the same in all simulations, but if sampled from a distribution, its categorization may vary from simulation to simulation. This categorization is used for some operating characteristic output such as “The number of good arms that were successful” and plots.</p>

<p>An example of how this can be important is considering a quantity like power: the probability of success given the treatment has some assumed level of effect. When the treatment effect is assumed to have some fixed value this calculation is easy. When the treatment effect is drawn from a distribution, sometimes the effect is strong, but sometimes it’s weak or even null/negative. Creating a classification system allows for the replacement of a traditional “power” with the probability of success given that the arm’s efficacy falls into the “good” class.</p>
<p>It’s still typical to consider an arm’s Type I error to be the probability of success given the arm has a fixed efficacy exactly equal to the control arm.</p>
</section>
<section id="response-specification" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="response-specification">Response Specification</h2>
<p>This tab allows for the specification of the efficacy assumptions for the control and treatment arms in the platform. It is expected that multiple VSR scenarios will be created, so that the design can be simulated across various treatment effect assumptions.</p>
<p>For a continuous endpoint, the control arm can have a known mean response or a distribution of potential control rates. The standard deviation of the final response is always assumed as a fixed value. The treatment effects for a continuous trial can be specified as known means, known changes from the control arm, or simulated from a distribution of effects.</p>
<p>For a dichotomous endpoint, the control arm can have a fixed assumed response rate or a response rate drawn from a distribution. The treatment arms can be specified has response rates, change from control on the probability scale, change from control on the log-odds scale, or have a change from baseline drawn from a distribution.</p>

<p>This sub-tab differs for a dichotomous endpoint in that there are options for how to specify the treatment effect, and no specification of a standard deviation or baseline value is required. The response rate must be specified for each arm. There are four ways that the mean response can be specified.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Fixed response rate. This specifies the actual response rate for the arm in the Value column. This option is somewhat redundant with the fixed effect option, except in the case when the control arm is sampled from a distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed <em>effect</em> (rate). This specifies the response rate difference between the treatment arm and the control arm in the Value column. Note: FACTS does <em>not</em> use the convention that positive effects always indicate improvement. I.e., if “Lower response is improvement” is specified on the Trial &gt; Trial Info tab, an effective arm should have a negative effect value. If an effect size would cause a value to be outside of the range [0, 1], then it is set at the appropriate boundary.<br>
This option is not available for the control arm.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed effect (<em>log-odds</em>). This specifies the Value column as the difference between the logit of the response rate for the treatment arm and logit of the response rate for the control arm.<br>
This option is not available for the control arm.</p></li>
<li><p>A distribution. Rather than specifying a specific value for the response rate, a distribution of values can be chosen. Each simulated trial will then have a (possibly) different value for the response rate for the arm. Distributions will be available for selection in the drop-down menu for the treatment arms, with one option for each distribution profile set up on the Virtual Response &gt; Explicitly Defined &gt; Treatment Distribution sub-tab. If a distribution is chosen, the value in the Value column is ignored.<br>
If this selection is made for the control arm, the selection is called “Sampled”, and the distribution is specified on this tab, in the “Control Sampled Response Rate” box.</p></li>

<p>The simulation of distribution of baseline scores is specified using a normal distribution –with user specified mean and standard deviation and optionally applied upper and lower bounds to reflect limitations on the score range or screening criteria. Note that if the observed baseline score is truncated, then the <strong><em>true</em></strong> mean and SD of the baseline are likely to be different from these values of the mean and SD which are before truncation.</p>
<p>Either baseline is simulated separately from the final response (for use with BOCF), or the simulation of the final response can include a baseline dependent element.</p>
<p>If adjusting the final response based on baseline, then the user selects “Use Baseline Adjustment for Subject Response” and supplies 3 parameters:</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></dt>
<dd>
a coefficient that reflects the degree of influence of baseline on final score and the degree of variability in the final score due to baseline.
</dd>
<dt>c</dt>
<dd>
a centering offset, typically the expected mean of the observed baseline scores
</dd>
<dt>s</dt>
<dd>
a scaling element, typically set to the expected SD of the baseline.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Example – in the above screenshot a baseline of mean 25 and SD 10 has been specified – so a centering of 25 and scaling of 10 is used. Wishing to simulate an overall SD of 5 in the final change from baseline and apportion two-thirds the variance to baseline, Beta has been set as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The desired final variance is 25 (5<sup>2</sup>), divided between 1/3<sup>rd</sup> dose response and 2/3<sup>rd</sup> baseline effects.</p></li>
<li><p>The SD of the simulated response is set to 2.89 <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\left( 25*\frac{1}{3} \right)}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The SD of the scaled baseline score is 1, so to contribute half the final variance of 25, Beta is set to 4.08 <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\left( 25*\frac{2}{3} \right)}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Note that when simulating a baseline effect in this way, limiting the range of baseline by specifying upper and lower cut-offs – which might be natural limits of the endpoint, or due to inclusion / exclusion criteria in the protocol – can significantly reduce the variance in the final endpoint due to the baseline effect.</p></li>

<section id="accrual" class="level1">
<h1>Accrual</h1>
<p>The Accrual tab provides an interface for specifying accrual profiles; these define the mean recruitment rate week by week during the trial. During the simulation, the simulator uses a Poisson process to simulate the random arrival of subjects with the specified mean accrual rate.</p>
<p>Accrual profiles are list on the left of the screen, as depicted below. These accrual profiles may be renamed by double-clicking on them, and typing a new profile name. After creating a profile the user must create at least one recruitment region. Early in the trial design process, detailed simulation of the expected accrual pattern is typically not necessary and a single region with a simple mean accrual rate is sufficient.</p>
<p>To model more accurately the expected accrual rates over the trial, the user may specify multiple regions for each accrual profile and separately parameterize them. Regions are added via the table in the center of the screen (Figure 7‑1). Within this table, the user may modify:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the peak, mean weekly recruitment rate,</p></li>
<li><p>the start date (in weeks from the start of the trial) for this recruitment region,</p></li>
<li><p>whether the region will have a ramp up phase and if so when the ramp up will be complete (in weeks from the start of the trial).</p></li>
<li><p>Whether the region will have a ramp down, and if so when the ramp down start and when the ramp down will complete (in weeks from the start of the trial).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ramp up/ramp down define simple linear increase/decreases in mean recruitment rate from the start to the end of the ramp. Note that simulation of accrual is probabilistic but ramp downs are defined in terms of time, so even if ramp downs are planned so that at the average accrual rate they will occur as the trial reaches cap, there is a risk in simulations when accrual has been slower than average, that ramp downs occur before the full sample size is reached. It is advisable to have at least one region that doesn’t ramp down to prevent simulations being unable to complete.</p>
<p>A graph of the recruitment rate of the highlighted region is shown as well. As the recruitment parameters are changed, the graph will update to show the time at which full accrual is reached. An accrual profile that does not reach full accrual is invalid and cannot be used to run simulations.</p>

<p>In the screenshot above you can see the two step ramp up in accrual from four regions – each starting at different offsets into the trial.</p>
<p>Note that the accrual profile graph is only the mean of the actual accrual per month; the simulated accrual is done using exponential distributions for the intervals between subjects, derived from the mean accrual profile specified here. Thus, some simulated trials will recruit more quickly than the specified rate, and some more slowly.</p>
<p>There are commands to import and export region details from/to simple external XML files. When importing, the regions defined in the external file are <strong>added</strong> to the regions already defined, they don’t replace them.</p>
<p>This is an example of a very simple region file defining just one region:</p>

<p>The platform trials engine QOI tab is largely the same as the <a href="../../../documentation/v71/userguides/core/qois.html">FACTS Core QOI tab</a>, so the differences between the two engine’s QOI tabs are the main focus of this section.</p>
<section id="analysis-population" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-population">Analysis Population</h3>
<p>Unlike in the FACT Core QOI tab, the Posterior Probability, Predictive Probability, and p-value QOIs have an option to select the Analysis Population used to calculate them. The analysis population can either be “All Participants” or “Concurrent Controls.”</p>
<p>The “All Participants” selection computes all model quantities based on the data from all participants in the trial at the time of the analysis, regardless of the arm assignment, including arms that are no longer active in the trial.</p>
<p>The “Concurrent Controls” selection restricts the database to only the treatment arm being evaluated and participants randomized to the control arm concurrently with that arm’s enrolment. The definition of <em>concurrence</em> is those participants randomized to one of these two arms from the time of analysis back to the <em>start time</em> of the treatment arm (when the arm became available for randomization rather than when the first patient was actually randomized), plus a window of time prior to that, as input on the Design &gt; Control Response tab.</p>
<p>When using “Concurrent Controls” models, each treatment arm has it’s own model that is run on its individual dataset. An arms QOIs are calculated based on that arm’s model, and no QOIs for any other arm are calculated from the concurrent dataset of an arm. Thus, when a final analysis is run for a treatment arm, concurrent QOIs for other arms are not computed. When an arm is removed from the study, its concurrent dataset is locked. This means that the concurrent QOIs for an arm that has been removed in the study will persist as the final analysis calculated QOIs for that arm, and will continue to appear in the trial output.</p>

This is because in Core, multiple arms are used to make a single trial-wide decision. In FACTS Platform Trials, a decision is made separately for each arm.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="control-response">Control Response</h2>
<p>This sub-tab is used to set up the normal prior distribution for the control arm. There are two separate priors to create - one for the all participants model, and one for the concurrent controls only model.</p>
<p>In the all participants model, only the prior mean and standard deviation for the shared control arm must be entered. The treatment effect priors are specified on the Treatment Response tab. All arms are modeled independently in the platform trials engine.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Concurrent Control box allows for the specification of the fixed normal prior for the control arm estimate for all of the individual concurrent controls models. The concurrent control arm esimate for all arms has the same prior. There is also a box to specify a window before the arms begin randomizing in which the randomized control participants should be considered concurrent with an active arm. So, if it’s specified that FACTS should include participants up to “8” weeks from treatment entering trial, then all control subjects randomized between 8 weeks before an arm started randomizing to when an arm stopped randomizing (or the current time if still randomizing) are considered concurrent controls.</p>

<p>This tab also contains the prior distribution for the standard deviation of the responses. The variance is modeled as an inverse-gamma distribution.</p>
<p>This tab also contains the method for handling missing data due to dropouts.

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="constant-proportion-allocated-to-control">Constant proportion allocated to control</h4>
<p>For this option, the proportion of participants that are allocated to the control arm remains constant, regardless of the number of treatment arms that are active in the trial. The user specifies the number of control participants and treatment participants per sub-block. A full block consists of a number of sub-blocks corresponding to the number of active treatment arms being allocated. Within each sub-block, the number of control participants is fixed, while the participants for any particular active treatment arm may be spread across the sub-blocks.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose the inputs for constant proportion allocated to control are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allocation to control per sub-block = 2</p></li>
<li><p>Allocation to treatments per sub-block = 6</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, “Sub-block size per treatment” is calculated to be 8. Suppose that there are currently 3 active arms accruing and 1 control arm.</p>
<p>When randomizing participants, the blocks that subjects allocations are drawn from are then a total size of <span class="math inline">\(8*4=32\)</span>. It is guaranteed that each sub-block of 8 within the total 32 will have exactly 2 control. The other 24 slots in the block are completely suffled, so there is no guarantee that any number of a non-control arm will be contained within the sub-blocks.</p>

<p>For this option, the proportion allocated to the control arm is allowed to vary depending on the number of active treatment arms in the trial. For each potential number of active treatment arms, the user specifies the allocation to each treatment and control by specifying Y and X for that allocation Y:Y:…:Y:X. That is, each treatment arm gets an equal number of participants per block, while the control has a (possibly) different allocation.

<section id="rar-probabilities" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rar-probabilities">RAR Probabilities</h4>
<p>The response-adaptive randomization (RAR) follows the same <a href="../../../documentation/v71/userguides/core/design/allocation.html#adaptive-allocation">scheme as FACTS Core</a> with respect to specifying the quantity(ies) of interest to use in determining allocation by arm. However, one important difference is the definition of the burn-in period.</p>
<p>Unlike FACTS Core, the burn-in period applies to each treatment arm separately rather than to the beginning of the trial.</p>
<p>The fixed allocation period for each treatment arm is specified at the bottom of the Allocation sub-tab. A treatment arm is not part of the RAR scheme until this number of participants have been enrolled <em>and</em> an analysis has been run to update the relevant QOIs. This latter aspect is distinct from FACTS Core, where an analysis is always run as soon as the allocation burn-in period has completed. The user may need to consider this aspect when determining how interim timing is to be set up. While in the burn-in phase, a treatment arm is allocated a fixed 1/T ratio of the adaptive allocation slots, where T is the number of active treatment arms.</p>

<section id="update-frequency" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="update-frequency">Update Frequency</h3>
<p>Trial updates can be specified by time, information, a mixture of time and information, or by milestones reached.</p>
<p>Information is defined in the same way as FACTS Core, either by number of participants enrolled, number of participants with complete data (at a particular visit when longitudinal modeling is used), or number of participants who have had the opportunity to provide complete data (at a particular visit when longitudinal modeling is used). This definition of information is used for milestones as well as (optionally) update timing.</p>
<p>There are two distinct modes for trial update timing. A radio button toggles between “Updates occur whenever a treatment milestone is met” and “Updates occur on a regular schedule”. The former option is only available if Fixed Allocation is chosen on the Design &gt; Allocation sub-tab.</p>
<section id="updates-occur-whenever-a-treatment-milestone-is-met" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="updates-occur-whenever-a-treatment-milestone-is-met">Updates occur whenever a treatment milestone is met</h4>
<p>In this mode, the only time an analysis is performed is when a treatment arm reaches a milestone – i.e.&nbsp;when a particular level of information has been reached, as specified in the Treatment Milestones portion of the sub-tab. The analysis will include all patients enrolled up to that point in time and provide model output for all arms, but decisions will be made only for the treatment arm whose milestone triggered the analysis. An analysis will also occur if a treatment arm has reached full follow-up on its maximum number of enrolled participants.</p>
</section>
<section id="updates-occur-on-a-regular-schedule" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="updates-occur-on-a-regular-schedule">Updates occur on a regular schedule</h4>
<p>In this mode, analyses are performed on a regular schedule based on time or information at the trial level (based on all participants). The timing of the first update can be specified as either time from the start of the trial or a fixed level of information. If adaptive allocation is being utilized, it may begin after this first analysis, provided that at least one individual treatment arm burn-in has been reached. After the first update, updates can be specified to occur at either fixed time intervals or after a fixed incremental level of information has accrued.</p>
<p>Note that in this mode, it is possible for treatment milestones to be skipped. E.g. if milestones were set up to occur at enrollment of 30, 55, and 80 participants, it is possible that a treatment arm could have 20 participants enrolled at one trial update and 60 participants at the next. If this were the case, any decisions associated with milestone 1 would be skipped and milestone 2 decisions would be evaluated instead.</p>
<p>An exception to the regular schedule is that an analysis is always performed whenever a treatment arm has reached its time for a final analysis. When this happens, an “off-schedule” trial update is performed, but no actions are taken except for the declaration of success or futility for the completed arm.</p>

<section id="subject-follow-up-options" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="subject-follow-up-options">Subject Follow-up Options</h3>
<p>The follow-up options mimic those of FACTS Core. However, in the Platform Trial simulator, the follow-up decision applies only to those participants that were allocated to the arm that is being stopped. Control participants and participants on other treatment arms continue to be followed.</p>
</section>
<section id="treatment-milestones" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="treatment-milestones">Treatment Milestones</h3>
<p>Treatment milestones are benchmarks that a treatment can reach that determine which success/futility fules should be used on the arm at that point in time. Before an arm has reached a milestone, there are no success or futility rules for that arm to evaluate. Once it reaches the first milestone, any time its status is evaluated it will use the set of success/futility rules that correspond to the most recent milestone that has been reached.</p>
<p>If updates occur every time a treatment milestone is met, then there is an update performed immediately every time an arm crosses a milestone threshold. This update is specific to the arm reaching the threshold, and while all arm data is used in the analysis models, only the arm that reached the threshold can make a decision at this milestone based update.</p>
<p>When updates are regularly scheduled, an update triggers based on the specified rules, and all arms have an opportunity to make a decision as long as they have reached at least the first milestone. Each arm keeps track of its own milestone benchmark and uses its own rules based on its progress through the platform. When regularly scheduled updates are selected, further input from the user is required in the Treatment Milestones box to dictate if milestone specific criteria can be assessed many times, or only once.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Evaluate milestone criteria at each update</dt>
<dd>
With this selection, decisions associated with a particular milestone may be evaluated more than once. E.g., suppose milestones occurred at enrollment of 30 and 55 participants, and at a trial update with 32 participants enrolled, an early futility decision was evaluated. At the next trial update, if only 50 participants are enrolled, the early futility decision associated with milestone 1 would be re-evaluated with the updated model results.
</dd>
<dt>Evaluate milestone criteria when milestone first reached</dt>
<dd>
With this selection, a given milestone can be evaluated at most once – the first time it is reached (if a higher milestone hasn’t already been reached). In the example above, there would be no futility evaluation at 50 participants because the milestone had already been evaluated to 32 participants.

<section id="successfutility-criteria" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="successfutility-criteria">Success/Futility Criteria</h2>
<p>The success/futility criteria sub-tab is used to specify the rules for early stopping and final evaluation. The basic structure of defining criterion with a QOI, a direction, and a threshold follows the conventions used in FACTS Core. However, the Platform Trial Simulator has some differences and additions, as outlined below.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Early stopping criteria can be set up for each milestone defined on the Design &gt; Interims sub-tab. Use the Create button to add a sub-tab for early stopping for a chosen milestone. There are check-boxes to indicate if early futility or early success should be evaluated at the milestone. If the same decision criteria are to be used for multiple consecutive milestones, then only the first in the series needs to be created, and subsequent milestones will use the criteria until a new milestone decision rule applies. E.g., if the first and second milestones use early futility with the same stopping criteria, while early success is not allowed until the third milestone, the user need only set up the Milestone 1 and Milestone 3 criteria. For convenience, the “Copy from” button can be used to copy all criteria from a different milestone. The Final Evaluation criteria are applied for a treatment arm only if: 1) the treatment arm has enrolled participants and followed up its maximum number of participants, or 2) the treatment arm had previously hit an early stopping criteria and has completed all expected follow-up on its participants.</p>
<p>One fundamental difference from FACTS Core in setting up a decision criterion is that all QOIs are available, not the scalar “Decision QOIs” that FACTS Core uses. The value utilized is always the one corresponding to the treatment arm whose milestone is being evaluated.</p>
<p>The Platform Trial simulator also allows for differential specification of evaluation criteria by treatment arm. Any criteria that are specified on the “All Treatments” sub-tab apply to each treatment arm, and only on this sub-tab can the checkboxes for early stopping be checked. The combination of “All Treatments” criteria are combined with the criteria for an individual treatment in the following way.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The criteria on the “All Treatments” tab are combined with the AND/OR as specified on that tab to determine an “All Treatments” TRUE or FALSE.</p></li>
<li><p>The criteria on the individual treatment arm’s tab are combined with the AND/OR as specified on that tab to determine an individual treatment arm TRUE or FALSE.</p></li>
<li><p>The “All Treatments” and individual treatment results are then combined differently for early success or futility:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For success, the two are combined with an AND – both must be met (as typically a specific treatment arm would be allowed to have a stricter rule for success but not a laxer rule).</p></li>
<li><p>For futility, the two are combined with an OR – either can be met (as typically a specific treatment arm might be allowed more leeway to withdraw from a trial).</p></li>

<p>N.B. Each time the FACTS application opens, the “Number of Simulations” will be set to the number of simulations last run for this design. If completed results are available, the <em>actual</em> number of simulations run for each scenario is reported in the ‘Num Sims’ column of the results table. The value displayed in the “Number of Simulations” control is the number of simulations that <em>will be</em> run if the user clicks on the ‘Simulate’ button.</p>
<p>Note also that if a scenario uses an external VSR file or directory of external files<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, the number of simulations will be rounded down to the nearest complete multiple of the number of VSR lines or external files. Unless the number of simulations requested ‘S’ is less than the number of VSR lines or external files, in which case just the first S are run. Finally note that the simulations will be performed in packets such that each packet only uses one external VSR line or file, so packet sizes may be smaller than requested.</p>
<p>N.B. FACTS uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in the generation of simulated patient response data and trial results. In order to exactly reproduce a statistical set of results, it is necessary to start the Markov Chain from an identical “Random Seed”. The initial random seed for FACTS simulations is set from the simulation tab, the first thing that FACTS does is to draw the random number seeds to use at the start of each simulation. It is possible to re-run a specific simulation, for example to have more detailed output files generated, by specifying ‘start at simulation’.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Number of simulations is the number of times to simulate each scenario.</p></li>
<li><p>Start at simulation, should normally be left as ‘1’, unless you want to reproduce a specific simulation from a previous run – which can be useful for debugging. Say the 999<sup>th</sup> simulation out of a larger set of simulations displayed some unusual behavior, in order to understand why, one might want to see the individual interim analyses for that simulation (the “weeks” file), the sampled patient results for that simulation (the “Patients” files) and possibly even the MCMC samples from the analyses in that simulation. You can save the .facts file with a slightly different name (to preserve the existing simulation results), then run 1 simulation of the specific scenario, specifying that the simulations start at simulation 999 and that at least 1 weeks file, 1 patients file and the MCMC samples file (see the “MCMC settings” dialog) are output.</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><p>The parallelization packet size, this allows simulation jobs to be split into runs of no-more than the specified number of trials to simulate. If more simulations of a scenario are requested than can be done in one packet, the simulations are started as the requisite number of packets and the results combined and summarized when they are all complete – so the final results files look just as though all the simulations were run as one job or packet. FACTS tries to set a sensible default size given the overall number of simulations to be run.</p></li>
<li><p>When running simulations on the local machine FACTS enterprise version will process as many packets in parallel as there are execution threads on the local machine. The overhead of packetization is quite low so a packet size of 10 to 100 can help speed up the overall simulation process – threads used to simulate scenarios that finish quicker can pick up packets for scenarios that take longer, if the number of scenarios is not directly divisible by the number of threads packetization uses all threads until the last few packets have to be run and finally the “Simulations complete” figure can be updated at the end of each packet, so the smaller the packet the better FACTS can report the overall progress.</p></li>

<p>Even a small change in the random seed will produce different simulation results.</p>

<p>The first two values specify two standard MCMC parameters –</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The length of burn-in is the number of the initial iterations whose results are discarded, to allow the MCMC chain to reach its equilibrium distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of samples is the number of subsequent iterations whose results are recorded in order to give posterior estimates of the values of interest.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An additional MCMC parameter controls the sampling within sampling when the analysis includes imputation from a longitudinal or predictor model:</p>
<ul>
<li>The third parameter controls the number of MCMC samples taken between each imputation of missing data using the longitudinal model, the default value is 1. This parameter only has an effect if Bayesian imputation is being used to impute a significant proportion of your data. This allows the parameter estimates to converge somewhat for each set of imputed data, if the imputed data is only a small percentage of the overall data this is unnecessary. As a rough guide, if it at some early interims &gt; 5% of the data being analyzed will be imputed, a value in the range 2 to 10 is recommended to avoid underestimating the uncertainty. A higher number should be used the greater the proportion of imputed data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two parameters concern the output of the MCMC samples to a log file:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is possible to have the design engine output the sampled values in the MCMC, in all of the interims of the first N simulated trials of each scenario by specifying the “Number of MCMC files to output” (setting N &gt; 0).

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-many-simulations-to-run">How many simulations to run?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>After first entering a design it is worth running just a small number of simulations such as 10, to help check that the scenarios and design have been entered correctly. Things to check might be: a) making sure treatments seem to be entering the trial on a reasonable schedule (the “Per Sim: Arm and Participant Arrivals” graph can be useful in checking this), b) making sure the overall trial is stopping for the expected reason, c) the true response values match what was expected from the virtual response entries, d) milestones are being evaluated when expected.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the overall structure looks generally correct, it is usually worth quickly collecting rough estimates of the operating characteristics using around 100 simulations for each scenario. This amount is often enough to spot designs with very poor operating characteristics such as very high false positive rates, false negative rates, or over-enrolling arms that should stop early.</p></li>
<li><p>Once operating characteristics appear to be in a reasonable range, one might typically need 1,000 or more simulations of each scenario to better quantify operating characteristics. When the Virtual Response is using distributions, the number of simulations might need to be even higher, if one wants to identify operating characteristics over the full range of virtual responses, since some simulations may contain no virtual responses in a particular range.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<section id="what-packet-size-to-use" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-packet-size-to-use">What packet size to use?</h2>
<p>You must specify a packet size that is a factor of the number of simulations per scenario to run; this offers the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If running locally a small packet size allows the simulation of an individual scenario to be divided between the different number of CPUs in your laptop or PC. This is beneficial because often some scenarios are quicker to simulate (e.g.&nbsp;they often stop early) than others<strong>;</strong> if simulations were being divided between cores simply at the scenario level, this would lead to idle cores, once the simulations had completed. Additionally if the number of cores did not directly divide into the number of scenarios there would be cores idle as the last scenarios were simulated.</p></li>
<li><p>The “Simulations completed” count will be updated more frequently.</p></li>
<li><p>If running on a grid then having a small packet size means the job can be distributed over more nodes in the grid and thus completed more quickly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note, the overhead of creating the packets and re-combining the results is low compared to the time to run the simulations.</p>
<p>Packet sizes of between 10 (when running 100 simulations) and 100 (when running 10000 simulations) are recommended.</p>
<p>Care should be taken when packetizing a scenario that includes an external data file to supply the virtual patient responses; in this situation, a of copy of the external file is included <em>in each packet</em> which can cause the packetisation process to run out of memory as the packets are being created. In this case, use a smaller number of larger packets, such as packets that are 1/10<sup>th</sup> of the total number of simulations.</p>

<p>A user with access to a computational grid, may choose to run simulations on the grid instead of running them locally. This frees the user’s computer from the computationally intensive task of simulating so that they can continue other work or even shutdown their PC or laptop. In order to run simulations on the grid, it must first be configured, this is normally done via a configuration file supplied with the FACTS installation by the IT group responsible for the FACTS installation.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="open-in-r">Open in R</h2>
<p>If aggregated results files have been created, then the Open in R button will start R and load the aggregated ‘.csv’ files.</p>
<p>If there are no aggregated files then the results files of the currently selected scenario are loaded. R can also be opened in this fashion by right clicking on a row in the simulation results table.</p>
<p>When FACTS starts R it writes out an R auto run startup script that loads the csv files into R as separate dataframes.</p>
</section>
<section id="aggregation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aggregation">Aggregation</h2>
<p>Aggregation combines the csv output from multiple scenarios into fewer csv files. The Aggregate… button displays a dialog which allows the user to select what to aggregate.</p>
<p><img src="./platformattachments/media/image36.png" style="width:5.17708in;height:4.28194in"></p>
<p>The default location for the aggregated files is the results directory for the study, but this can be changed.</p>
<p>Aggregation may be performed with or without pivoting on group, or both.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unpivoted files will have one row for each row in the original files.</p></li>
<li><p>In pivoted files each original row will be split into one row per dose.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Where there is a group of columns for each dose, they will be turned into a single column with each value on a new row.</p></li>
<li><p>Values in columns that are independent of dose will be repeated on each row.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The default is to aggregate all scenarios, but any combination may be selected.</p>
<p>Pressing “Aggregate” generates the aggregated files.</p>
<p>Each type of csv file is aggregated into a separate csv file whose name begins agg_ or agg_pivot_, so agg_summary.csv will contain the rows from each of the summary.csv files, unpivoted. WeeksNNNNN.csv files are aggregated into a single agg_[pivot_]weeks.csv file. PatientsNNNNN.csv files are aggregated into a single agg_patients.csv file, but they are never pivoted because each row already refers to a single dose.</p>
<p>RegionIndex.csv is not aggregated.</p>
<p>Each aggregated file begins with the following extra columns, followed by the columns from the original csv file:</p>

<section id="explore-graphs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="explore-graphs">Explore graphs</h2>
<p>Two graphs, one for futility and one for success, are available to help calibrate a design. For a particular treatment arm and a particular QOI, the line graph displays the proportion of simulated trials for which the QOI exceeds (or falls below) a threshold, indicating a potential way to set up early stopping rules to achieve desired operating characteristics.</p>
<p>These graphs require the use of weeks files to get detailed information updates, so it may be critical to increase the number of weeks files saved (as set on the Simulation tab, defaulting to 100) to provide sufficient information in these graphs.</p>
<p>Since the graphs rely on the existing simulations, then any early stopping that is applied will limit the data available for later interims, and make the data conditional on not stopping early, which may make interpretation difficult. Thus, it may better to run simulations with no early stopping when utilizing these graphs. However, unlike the Core engine where removing early stopping lead to identical results up to the stopping point of interest, removing early stopping from all arms may affect the trajectory of the platform trial, leading to fewer arms enrolling, a difference in proportion of controls, and other changes in behavior of the platform trial beyond the early stopping of arms. The graphs may provide rough estimates of where thresholds should be set, but ultimately, these will need to be calibrated in the context of early stopping for all arms.</p>

<h1>Output Files</h1>
<p>FACTS stores the results of simulations as ‘.csv’ files under a Results folder. For each row in the simulations table, there is a folder named by the profiles that make up the scenario, which contains the corresponding ‘.csv’ files.</p>
<p><img src="./platformattachments/media/image58.png" style="width:3.32379in;height:2.67357in"></p>
<p>These files can be opened using Microsoft Excel, but versions of Excel before 2007 are restricted to 256 columns, which is too few to view some files in their entirety. The ‘Calc’ application in ‘OpenOffice’ will show all the columns (and will open two files that have the same name at the same time!). Because Excel takes out a file lock on any file it has open, while a file is open in Excel it cannot be deleted or modified by another application. The most common cause for an error to be reported when simulating trials in FACTS is because the user has one of the previous results files is still open in Excel.</p>
<p>In the scenario directory there are the following types of results file:</p>
<p><strong>Summary.csv</strong> Contains a single row of data that summarizes the simulation results. This is the source of the shown on the simulations tab.</p>
<p><strong>Simulations.csv</strong> Contains one row per simulation describing the final state of each simulation for every trial simulated.</p>
<p><strong>PatientsNNNNN.csv</strong> Contains one row per patient in a simulation, where NNNNN is the number of the simulation. By default this file is written out only for the first simulation, but this can be changed on the simulations tab.</p>
<p><strong>WeeksNNNNN.csv</strong> Contains one row for each trial update during a simulation where NNNNN is the number of the simulation. By default this file is written only for the first 100 simulations, but this can be changed via the simulation tab. The values in the last row of the cohorts file will be the same as the final values for that simulation in the simulations.</p>
