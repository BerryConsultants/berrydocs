<h1>FACTS Overview</h1>
<p>This user guide assumes some limited general familiarity with FACTS and concentrates on describing the interface for designs using the N-CRM approach. See the FACTS Dose Escalation user guide for a general introduction to the FACTS Dose Escalation user interface.</p>
<p>The N-CRM is based on the method described in the paper <span class="citation" data-cites="neuenschwander2008critical">(<a href="#ref-neuenschwander2008critical" role="doc-biblioref">Neuenschwander, Branson, and Gsponer 2008</a>)</span>. It is designed for use in oncology phase 1 trials, and we understand generally in use at Novartis for the majority of their trials of this type:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dosing starts at a (very) low dose, strongly believed to be safe.</li>
<li>Usually after a cohort of subjects have completed their current dose, the dose to be used for the next cohort is selected. The selection of this dose is dictated by a combination of dose escalation rules, the estimate of the toxicity rate on the different doses and the target maximum tolerated toxicity, or toxicity band.</li>
<li>The endpoint per subject is binary: toxicity observed or not.</li>
<li>There is either a predefined set of doses to explore, or a dose range.</li>
<li>There is limited sample size.</li>
</ul>
<section id="facts-7.1-changes-to-n-crm" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="facts-7.1-changes-to-n-crm">FACTS 7.1 Changes to N-CRM</h2>
<p>In FACTS 7.1 there were new features added to N-CRM:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to backfill to the current escalation dose (also known as “frontfilling”).</li>
<li>It is now possible to specify a third queue concept – maximum number of patients in their DLT period on the current MTD estimate.</li>
<li>It is now possible to define the concept of “near” target/MTD as part of stopping rules, for both fine-grained and regular dosing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="facts-7.0-changes-to-n-crm">FACTS 7.0 Changes to N-CRM</h2>
<p>In FACTS 7.0 the only change was on the Analysis tab, when entering subject data manually, the FACTS GUI now ensures that a cohort number is entered for every subject.</p>

<section id="facts-6.5-changes-to-n-crm" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="facts-6.5-changes-to-n-crm">FACTS 6.5 Changes to N-CRM</h2>
<p>In FACTS 6.5 there was a new feature added to N-CRM:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to generate a design report – a Word document describing design - once the design has been simulated. In FACTS 6.5 there was two small changes to the functionality:</li>
<li>When deriving toxicity/efficacy priors from quantiles at the lowest and highest doses, the “middle” probability option now refers to the median dose rather than the reference dose and is now optional. When pre-6.5 FACTS files are loaded in FACTS 6.5, the “middle” probability option will be ignored and replaced by 0.5.</li>
<li>When deriving toxicity/efficacy priors from specific quantiles the specification of at least two dose levels is now required whereas previously the specification of at least three dose levels was required.</li>
</ul>
<p>In FACTS 6.5 there were some improvements in the simulated behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designs which include efficacy, the “Maximum cohorts used to determine MTD” parameter on the Allocation Rule tab is now observed, in FACTS 6.4 and earlier it was ignored.</li>
<li>In N-CRM designs using open enrollment without accrual pausing, FACTS will now output entries in the cohort file for subjects that have been lost following stopping rules being met.</li>
<li>In N-CRM designs using open enrollment, FACTS will no longer prematurely apply stopping conditions when there are still subjects whose outcomes have been observed, but not yet processed.</li>
<li>In N-CRM designs using open enrollment, FACTS will now report the selected MTD/MED/OSD and associated state to be the dose where the stopping conditions were first met, unless the MTD has subsequently decreased post stopping rules being met. This is to prevent a dose above the one selected when the stopping conditions were met being reported as the MTD when it is very likely that there is insufficient data on this higher dose to justify its selection. If rather than reporting the MTD at the point when the stopping rules where met, you would like the trial to resume if the dose selected as MTD has changed (and this the stopping rules possibly no longer met), ensure that the ”Pause accrual and wait for completers” option is selected on the “Stopping Criteria” tab. This allows the trial to resume if the recruitment cap has not been met.</li>
<li>FACTS Command Line mode and FLFLL (FACTS Linux File Loader Lite) now correctly handle the processing of N-CRM designs whose prior was derived using the “Legacy Prior” option.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="facts-6.4-changes-to-n-crm" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="facts-6.4-changes-to-n-crm">FACTS 6.4 Changes to N-CRM</h2>
<p>In FACTS 6.4 there were no changes to the Dose Escalation simulators.</p>
</section>
<section id="facts-6.3-changes-to-n-crm" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="facts-6.3-changes-to-n-crm">FACTS 6.3 Changes to N-CRM</h2>
<p>In FACTS 6.3 a number of changes were made to improve facilities in N-CRM, or improve the way existing facilities were implemented. These were:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>New run-in options: the existing run-in scheme is available as “simple run-in”, “custom run-in” allows a specific sequence of doses and number of subjects to test at each dose to be specified, “small cohort pre-escalation” allows a run that uses a smaller cohort size but follows the dose escalation rules and over dose control.</li>
<li>New “backfill” options in open enrolment. Backfill allows subjects that become available at a time when they can’t be allocated to the current dose (because the maximum number of subjects without final results have already been allocated to the current dose).</li>
<li>Improved handling of “maximum subjects without final results” in open enrolment. In earlier versions of FACTS this was a “global” maximum, which led to a suboptimal allocation pattern and overly cautious rejection of subjects that became available. The new model applies a maximum “per dose” so that once the trial has escalated to a new dose strength, any subjects without final results on lower doses do not block allocation to the new dose, in addition it is possible to specify two different maximums – one for when a dose has just been escalated to but has not been “cleared” (typically smaller and more cautious), and one when a dose has been cleared but we continue to allocate to it because it is the target dose (typically larger and more confident). This method is such an improvement that we recommend moving any design using open enrolment to this new version of FACTS.</li>
<li>Improved Ordinal Toxicity model – the way the likelihood is calculated has been improved – reducing the uncertainty in the model fit. Any design using an ordinal model will need to re-calibrate the prior if you move the design to FACTS 6.3. If you have a design already complete, or in execution we recommend you remain using the earlier version of FACTS for that trial.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="facts-6.2-changes-to-n-crm" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="facts-6.2-changes-to-n-crm">FACTS 6.2 Changes to N-CRM</h2>
<p>In FACTS 6.2 features available separately in the other FACTS CRM engines (CRM (Toxicity), bCRM &amp; CRM Ordinal) were all incorporated into N-CRM. This allowed these features to be used in conjunction with N-CRM’s target toxicity band methodology, overdose control and open enrollment features, as well as in conjunction with each other for the first time.</p>
<p>The new features are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From CRM (Toxicity) the option to specify that the data is coming from ‘two groups’ and for the toxicity experienced in the two groups to be modelled with a joint model [CRM 2 Sample]. This allows a trial where there are two patient populations (such as adults and children) or where there are two versions of the treatment to be simulated.</li>
<li>From bCRM the option to model a second binary efficacy endpoint [bCRM] and the for dose allocation to proceed in two stages – the first to establish an MTD and the second to establish an MED.</li>
<li>From CRM Ordinal the option for the toxicity endpoint to be modelled not as binary endpoint, but one with different categories of toxicity, and with a joint model applied to the different categories [CRM Ordinal]. The endpoint can be to model either 3 or 4 categories of toxicity:
<ol type="a">
<li>category 1 is “no toxicity”,</li>
<li>category 2 is “mild toxicity”,</li>
<li>category 3 is “toxicity”</li>
<li>category 4 (if included) is “severe toxicity”</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>All decision making is made in terms of the probability of observing a category 3 (or worse) toxicity.</p>

<p>In FACTS 6.1 N-CRM has the new feature of ‘design variants’ that allow the user to easily simulate and evaluate an N-CRM design at different sample sizes. This change includes 4 elements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Under the ‘Study’ tab the user can now specify the number of design variants, and for each variant the maximum study size in Cohorts.</li>
<li>On the simulation tab FACTS will display a copy of each simulation scenario for each variant.</li>

<section id="n-crm-dose-escalation-design-concepts" class="level1">
<h1>N-CRM Dose Escalation Design Concepts</h1>
<p>In an N-CRM dose escalation trial, subjects are exposed to the novel treatment at increasing dose strengths, not progressing to the next dose strength until lower doses have been shown to be sufficiently safe, and not progressing beyond the dose which appears to display the maximum tolerated rate of toxicity, or the target rate of toxicity, the “Maximum Tolerated Dose” (MTD). To limit the risk of exposing subjects to a new, higher dose strength, subjects are allocated in “cohorts’ of a given size and no further subjects are recruited until all the subjects in the cohort complete treatment and follow-up. To enroll subjects quicker and introduce further options to manage the risk of exposure at new doses, FACTS allows “Open Enrolment” of new subjects, which is a form of design that dispenses with cohorts and is described in <a href="#sec-concepts-oe">this section</a>.</p>
<p>Once all the subjects in a cohort have completed, FACTS updates its analysis of the dose toxicity, re-evaluates the dose-escalation rules and selects the dose the next cohort will be allocated to. As well as the final results of each simulated trial, each time a cohort completes FACTS outputs the data available and the results of the analysis. These are referred to as “cohorts files”, and when you run the simulations, you can specify for how many of them you want these additional files written out.</p>
<p>The design’s default behavior is to allocate the next cohort to the model estimated MTD, but this is typically modified by several user specified rules. Note that if all the rules are met, the allocation is to the model estimated MTD, it will never allocate above it.</p>
<p>The rules that are available to modify this behavior, to achieve “not progressing to the next dose strength until lower doses have been shown to be sufficiently safe” are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting dose: the dose strength to be allocated to the first cohort. (Specified on the Design &gt; Allocation Rule tab)</li>
<li>Overdose control: a limit can be specified on the probability that a dose’s toxicity rate is above a certain level, and any dose for which this is true is excluded from allocation. (Specified on the Study &gt; Toxicity tab)</li>
<li>Dose escalation rules: The size of the increase in dose strength from one cohort to the next can be specified (Specified on the Design &gt; Allocation Rule tab).</li>
<li>Single patient / small cohort run-in: a fixed dose allocation scheme can be specified, using a different (typically smaller) cohort size. That is applied without reference to any other rules or to the results of the analysis as long as no toxicities have been observed. If the trial includes what is thought to be a number of weak doses that are likely to have toxicity below the target rate, but are still required to be tested, using a run-in can make testing these doses cheaper and quicker.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the sections to follow, we describe overdose control, dose escalation rules and run-in features in the conventional context of cohort enrolment and a limited number of possible doses. We also describe the options FACTS allows to model the subjects in the trial as belonging to 2 different groups and the options to simultaneously model an efficacy endpoint. We subsequently describe how these are modified if:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are many potential dose strengths in a certain range that could be, but don’t have to be, administered in the trial (“fine grain dosing”).</li>
<li>we choose not to limit enrolment to cohorts but enroll subjects continuously (“open enrolment”).</li>
</ul>
<section id="overdose-control" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overdose-control">Overdose Control</h2>
<p>Overdose control can be specified on the Study &gt; Toxicity tab. Overdose control specifies a limit on the probability that a dose has a toxicity rate above a certain level. After fitting the Bayesian logistic regression model, all doses for which the posterior probability that their toxicity rate lies above the specified level exceeds the specified limit are ineligible for allocation. Because the Bayesian Logistic regression is monotonic, this means that after every analysis either all doses are permitted for allocation or there will be a dose level above which no dose is permitted for allocation.</p>

Figure&nbsp;1: Setting the overdose control limit
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The overdose control is specified in terms of the “toxicity bands” (concept of allowing ranges for the target toxicity, excess toxicity, unacceptable toxicity and under-dosing explained in more detail in <a href="#sec-study-tox-interval">this section</a>) and can either be in terms of the “excess and unacceptable toxicity bands” or just the “unacceptable toxicity band”. The “excess and unacceptable toxicity band” is every toxicity rate above the upper bound of the target band. Care should be taken when setting the permitted threshold for this joint band. If set below 0.5, it will likely exclude doses whose mean expected toxicity rate is within the target band with the risk that this makes the escalation decision in the design too cautious. Initially it might be recommended to just use the “unacceptable band” for specifying the overdose control. This allows an overdose control that is more strict – for example: “exclude any dose where the probability that the toxicity rate is above 0.6, is greater than 20%“. The lower bound for the unacceptable band can be set wherever desired, its only role is in defining this band for overdose control. It is also possible to specify that the limit changes over the course of the trial, allowing the overdose control to become stricter as more information becomes available. For example, one could reduce the permitted probability of a dose having a toxicity rate in the unacceptable band from 50% to 25% in steps of 2.5% after every cohort.</p>
</section>
<section id="dose-escalation-rules" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dose-escalation-rules">Dose Escalation Rules</h2>
<p>The dose escalation could be solely controlled by the overdose control (as originally proposed in <span class="citation" data-cites="neuenschwander2008critical">(<a href="#ref-neuenschwander2008critical" role="doc-biblioref">Neuenschwander, Branson, and Gsponer 2008</a>)</span>), however this means that the escalation behavior is very dependent on the interplay between the prior and the observed data. Usually, teams prefer to have a fixed set of rules in place ensuring the escalation behavior is sufficiently cautious. FACTS has an option to just use overdose control or to use a combination of overdose control and a set of fixed escalation rules. In the latter case, the following rules can be set in the Design &gt; Allocation Rule &gt; Allocation tab:</p>

Figure&nbsp;2: Dose escalation rules
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We introduce the notion of whether a dose has been “cleared”. A dose is cleared once we have sufficient data on it (usually, but not necessarily, the results of one cohort, but if the cohort size is small, for example 2 subjects, perhaps more than one cohort will be required). This can be supplemented by a rule that if the observed raw toxicity rate at the dose exceeds a certain limit, then the dose is not counted as cleared (this rule is usually unnecessary if overdose control limits have been set). Once a dose has been cleared, it stays cleared, meaning there is “maximum cleared dose”. The number of dose increments or the factor of dose strength above the current cleared dose that can be allocated to is then specified. For example, with doses of 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, we might allow escalation at two dose increments a time. In the figure below, you see the combination of settings used to achieve this behaviour alongside the “Fastest Possible Dose Escalation” plot on the right:</p>

Figure&nbsp;3: Escalation by number of dose increments
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Alternatively, we can specify the permitted escalation as a ratio, for example we might allow the dose strength to be at most tripled at each escalation, which, with the example dose strengths, makes the initial escalation more cautious:</p>

<p>The escalation rules can be adjusted so that instead of a single increment rule, there are different increments depending on the dose, or depending on the number of observed toxicities. To modify our earlier example, we can allow escalation by 2 dose levels while no toxicities have been observed, but limit it to only one dose level once one or more toxicities have been observed:</p>

<p>Lastly escalation can be relative to the highest cleared dose, or relative to the last dose allocated.</p>
<p>To summarize the allocation procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current maximum cleared dose is identified.</li>
<li>The current data is analyzed using the Bayesian Logistic Regression model.</li>
<li>The overdose rules are evaluated and all doses exceeding the overdose control limit are excluded from this escalation selection.</li>
<li>From the remaining doses, the dose best meeting the target MTD or target toxicity interval objective based on the model is selected as the “target dose” (TD).</li>
<li>If the TD is at or below the current maximum cleared dose, the next cohort is allocated to the TD.</li>
<li>If the TD is within the escalation rules of the current maximum cleared dose, the next cohort is allocated to the TD.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the next cohort is allocated to the highest dose above the current maximum cleared dose as allowed by the escalation rules.</li>

</section>
<section id="initial-run-in" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="initial-run-in">Initial Run-in</h2>
<p>The purpose of defining a run-in is to define a fixed allocation behavior to be followed up to the first toxicity being observed. The specified number of subjects to allocate to each dose in the run-in and which doses to test are specified. This scheme is followed until a toxicity is observed or we reach the end of this fixed scheme.</p>
<p>Three forms of run-in specification are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple: allocates a small cohort to every defined dose in ascending order (unless fine grain doses - see <a href="#sec-concepts-fgd">this section</a> – have been specified, in which case the escalation rules are followed).</li>
<li>Custom: allocates a defined number of subjects (possibly varying by dose) to selected doses in ascending order.</li>
<li>Small cohort pre-escalation: allocates a small cohort, but follows the escalation rules assuming just a single small cohort is required to clear a dose.</li>
</ul>
<p>All run-in schemes can be modified in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specifying a maximum dose at which the run-in stops if no toxicities are observed until that dose.</li>
<li>If ordinal toxicities are being simulated, the run-in may should at the first observed category 2 toxicity (rather than a category 3 toxicity)</li>
<li>Whether the subjects used in the run-in should be counted towards the trial sample size or not.</li>
<li>When a toxicity is observed the standard behavior is to allocate to the minimum of: the last dose tested in the run-in, the current TD or the highest dose that can be allocated to by the overdose rules. This can be replaced by expanding the allocation on the current dose to make it a full cohort as specified in Study &gt; Study Info tab (this option is particularly useful in conjunction with stopping for a category 2 toxicity).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="two-groups" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="two-groups">Two Groups</h2>
<p>FACTS has the option to model the subjects in the trial as belonging to two different groups, these can be either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two groups distinguished by a baseline property of the subjects, for example adults and paediatrics.</li>
<li>Two groups separated by a difference in treatment (and selected randomly), for example the study drug alone or in combination with an additional drug.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are options for when group 2 starts enrolling:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can be recruited sequentially – group 1 then group 2.</li>
<li>They can be recruited in parallel</li>
<li>The second group can be started when the allocation to the first group reaches a particular dose</li>
<li>The second group can be started when the number of subjects allocated to group 1 reaches a particular threshold.</li>
</ul>
<p>A joint model is fitted to the two groups.</p>
<p>The first group is modeled:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
logit(p_{1j}) = \alpha + \beta \hat{x}_j
\]</span></p>
<p>The second group is modeled:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
logit(p_{2j}) = (\alpha + a) + (\beta + b) \hat{x}_j
\]</span> With separate priors and some optional constraints on <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Dose escalation and stopping are judged independently for the two groups.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-concepts-efficacy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-concepts-efficacy">Efficacy</h2>
<p>FACTS has the option to additionally model an efficacy endpoint. There are currently two limitations in simulation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Only a binary efficacy endpoint can be simulated</li>
<li>The efficacy endpoint is assumed to be available at the same time as the toxicity endpoint.</li>
</ol>
<p>The efficacy and toxicity endpoints are modelled separately. There are options to specify early stopping rules for finding the MTD, and to specify a cap on the sample size that can be spent finding the MTD. Once these rules are met, then allocation is towards the Minimum Efficacious Dose (MED) – if this is below the MTD. If the estimated MED lies at or above the estimated MTD, the allocation is at the estimated MTD.</p>
<p>If while allocating to the estimated MED further toxicity results change the estimate of the MTD, and if there is now insufficient information on the MTD as specified by the early stopping rules for finding the MTD, allocation switches back to allocating to the estimated MTD, if the sample size cap for finding the MTD allows.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-concepts-fgd" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-concepts-fgd">Fine Grain Dosing</h2>
<p>In some settings, e.g.&nbsp;when the drug is delivered in solution by IV or when manufacturing allows any dose in a range from say 100mg to 400mg in steps of 10mg, dose strengths need not be restricted to just a small number of pre-defined levels. FACTS has a feature that allows this to be simulated, not with a continuous range of doses, but with “fine grain” dosing.</p>
<p>FACTS supports the specification of a range of doses from a minimum to a maximum with doses either equally spaced or spaced with equal ratio. Using dose ratio makes most sense it you want to use the dose strength whilst believing the effect will be roughly log-dose. Using dose ratios, it’s necessary to accept FACTS reporting dose strengths only close to those desired. As an example, if the main doses followed a dose doubling scheme: 12.5, 25, 50, etc., one might use fine grain dosing with dose space ratios of approximately the 4th root of 2 (1.1892). The resulting doses are 12.5, 14.865, 17.677, 21.022, 24.999, 29.729, 35.354, 42.043, 49.998, etc., which means there are three dose levels between each of the original doses.</p>
<p>There are two alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use nominal dose strengths 1, 2, 3, 4, … (i.e.&nbsp;assuming the dose spacing is linear in expected effect) and label the doses according to their actual strength.</li>
<li>Use a fixed dose interval (e.g.&nbsp;12.5 resulting in doses of 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50, 62.5, etc.) so the lower doses (of the original scheme) have fewer (or no) intermediate doses and the higher doses have many more. The dose escalation rules can be specified in terms of dose strength ratio to achieve the required escalation, for example allowing dose escalation with a dose strength ratio of 2 will result in the initial escalation using doses 12.5, 25, 50, 100, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as possibly adjusting the dose escalation step size to accommodate the new dose levels on the Design &gt; Allocation Rule tab, there are two other rules that may need modification:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To count a dose as “cleared”, we might now count cohorts on nearby doses to count towards the required clearing total. This is specified as the “Max ratio of dose strengths considered as near” (if dose allocation rules apply to ratio of dose strength) or “Delta in dose strength considered as near” (if dose allocation rules apply to dose strength) on the Design &gt; Allocation Rule tab.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if we have doses at roughly 4th root of 2 intervals, we might count any dose within a ratio of 1.2 as “near” so that any cohorts allocated to immediate neighbor doses count towards clearing a dose.</li>
<li>Alternatively, if we have doses every 12.5mg from 12.5 to 400, counting any dose within a ratio of 1.1 will mean that from dose 125 and above, immediate neighbor doses (within 12.5) count towards clearing a dose, and from dose 250 and above, doses within 25mg (two immediate neighbor doses) count towards clearing a dose.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The concept of “near doses” in fine grained dosing allows us to skip certain doses in the escalation phase, which might make sense if there is reason to believe that doses of similar dose strengths behave similarly and don’t provide enough additional information to justify assigning more cohorts to.</p>

In considering which doses are near, the same logic as on the Design &gt; Allocation Rule tab regarding Dose Strength or Ratio of Dose Strength will be used.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If Dose Strength is used, then on the Design &gt; Stopping Criteria tab, we can include cohorts on nearby doses to count towards the required number of cohorts on the estimated MTD by specifying “nearby” in terms of dose strength. For example, by +/- 12.5 mg:</p>

<section id="sec-concepts-oe" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-concepts-oe">Open Enrollment</h2>
<p>Open enrollment <span class="citation" data-cites="broglio2015bayesian">(<a href="#ref-broglio2015bayesian" role="doc-biblioref">Broglio et al. 2015</a>)</span> can be used instead of cohort enrollment. Cohort enrolment enrolls a fixed number of subjects to a given dose, then waits until their treatment and follow up is complete (so their final status – whether they suffered a DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicity) or not – is known) before deciding on the next dose to allocate to and then recruiting the next cohort. This likely means that subjects become available for inclusion in the trial, but have to be turned away as the trial waits for the current cohort to complete. Open enrollment attempts to address this by allowing subjects to be enrolled whilst the current “cohort” is completing. However, this may come with some risk – more than a cohort’s worth of subjects may now be exposed to a new dose before we have any estimate of its DLT rate. To allow this risk to be managed, open enrollment introduces two new concepts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>When allocating to an uncleared dose, a cap can be set on the number of subjects that can be allocated to that dose who have not yet got their final results (“OE cap 1”). For example, if this number is set to 3 (to be the same as a common cohort size), after 3 subjects have been recruited and allocated to the current dose, no more subjects will be allocated to this dose until at least one of these subjects has completed. Until then, potential subjects that become available will be turned away unless backfilling is enabled (see next point below). But unlike cohort enrolment, as soon as the first of the subjects on the dose completes, a subject that comes available could now be allocated to the dose, depending on further rules explained below (frontfilling) – unless of course that subject’s result has changed the estimated MTD. Note that the trial won’t escalate beyond the current dose until the required number of subjects to clear the dose have completed. By default, the trial won’t allocate more than the number of subjects required to clear the dose until the dose is cleared, meaning if 3 subjects are required to clear a dose and 3 subjects have been allocated to this dose, even when 1 or 2 of these subjects have their final results and a new subjects is enrolled, they won’t be allocated to this dose. If this is regarded as over cautious, it can be modified by enabling frontfilling, allowing 3 subjects without final results simultaneously. In the above example, this would mean we could place a fourth subject on the dose when the result of the first subject has come in and a fifth subject as soon as the result of the second subject has come in.</p></li>
<li><p>When the cap on the number of subjects without final results on an uncleared dose has been reached (“OE cap 1”) new potential subjects will be turned away, unless backfilling is enabled. Enabling backfilling allows these subjects to instead be included, allocating them to a lower dose that has already been cleared. Whilst such an allocation may not contribute as much to identifying the MTD as allocating to the current dose would, it can still contribute by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Increasing the information on the next lower dose can inform the estimate of toxicity on the current dose through the Bayesian logistic model.</li>
<li>Providing additional information on a dose that it may be necessary to de-escalate too if the current dose turns out to be too toxic.</li>
</ol>
<p>It can also contribute information on other endpoints (such as efficacy). Once backfilling has been enabled, it is also possible to enable frontfilling. For more information on backfilling and frontfilling, see <a href="#sec-concepts-bf">this section</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Assume at a given point in time we want to allocate a subject to a specific dose, denoted by “candidate dose”. FACTS allows 3 different caps to be specified on how many subjects who have not yet got their final results (i.e.&nbsp;are not yet complete) can be allocated to this candidate dose:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-concepts-bf">Backfilling and Frontfilling</h2>
<p>As described in the preceding section, Backfilling is the allocation of subjects to a lower dose when, due to restrictions, it is not possible to allocate a subject who comes available to the current dose <span class="citation" data-cites="dehbi2021controlled">(<a href="#ref-dehbi2021controlled" role="doc-biblioref">Dehbi, O’Quigley, and Iasonos 2021</a>)</span>. FACTS provides a number of options to configure how backfilling behaves. Backfilling can be enabled in the Study &gt; Study Info tab. The total sample size can be divided between the subjects allocated as part of conventional dose escalation and those allocated using backfill. When backfill is enabled, it is important to increase the total sample size and then limit the number that can be allocated using backfill, as subjects allocated using backfilling will not contribute to the escalation and the confirmation of the MTD and it’s usually important to retain sufficient sample size to achieve this aim.</p>

<li>Two maximum caps can be specified on the number of subjects that are assigned in the process of backfilling to a given dose:
<ul>
<li>an overall cap on subjects per dose that cannot be exceeded by backfill, counting also subjects that were assigned to that dose through regular allocation</li>
<li>a cap on the number of subjects per dose that were allocated by backfill, counting only subjects that were assigned to that dose using backfilling.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How many dose levels below the current dose can be allocated to when backfilling. Backfilling will always be to the highest dose possible (which might be the current dose if frontfilling is enabled, otherwise it will be below the current dose). Allocation to the next highest dose might be limited either by an open enrolment cap if there are already subjects allocated to that dose who have not yet completed, or it might be limited by the backfill caps described above. If allocation to the dose below the current dose is not possible, backfilling will by default look at the dose below that (two levels below the current dose) and so on. Using this option can ensure no backfilling happens to doses that are too far below the current dose.</li>
<li>The lowest dose that can be allocated to when backfilling. This option is particularly useful when there is reason to believe doses below a certain level will not be effective.</li>
<li>Whether frontfilling is allowed – frontfilling allows allocating more subjects to uncleared doses than the number required to clear that dose (see <a href="#sec-concepts-oe">this section</a>).</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="open-enrollment-backfilling-and-fine-grain-dosing">Open Enrollment, Backfilling and Fine Grain Dosing</h2>
<p>When using open enrolment and fine grain dosing, the interval defined on the Design &gt; Allocation Rule tab “Delta in dose strength considered as near +/-“, or “Max ratio of dose strengths considered as near” is crucial: it is used to define the range of doses where subjects allocated to any of them count towards clearing a dose.</p>
<ul>
<li>If dose allocation rules are selected to apply to “Dose strength”, the interval is defined “Delta in dose strength considered as near +/-“. Thus, for example, if this is set to 2, then subjects complete on doses with strength in the range 4-8 will contribute to the dose of strength 6 being cleared. At the same time, clearing the dose of strength 6 will automatically clear the dose of strength 8.</li>
<li>If dose allocation rules are selected to apply to “Ratio of strength”, the interval is defined “Max ratio of dose strengths considered as near“. Thus, for example if this is set to 1.5, then subjects complete on doses with strength in the range 4-9 will contribute to the dose of strength 6 being cleared. At the same time, clearing the dose of strength 6 will automatically clear the dose of strength 9. These ranges also apply when assessing “OE cap 1-3”, and how many subjects have been allocated overall, or via backfilling. In backfilling, FACTS checks each dose strength and the doses in its “near” interval range, at (if frontfilling) or below the current dose, until the first dose strength is found where backfilling can take place.</li>

<h1>The Study tab</h1>
<section id="sec-studyinfo" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-studyinfo">Study Info</h2>
<p>The Study Info sub-tab provides parameters for specifying:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the trial has an Efficacy endpoint as well as a Toxicity one.</li>
<li>Whether recruitment is in Cohorts or uses Open Enrolment,</li>
<li>Whether the trial data is being analyzed as a single population (single group) or two groups (which could be 2 different patient types, or 2 different treatment types).</li>
<li>The option to specify that the trial should include an expansion cohort once the MTD has been identified.</li>
<li>The option (if using open enrolment) to specify the use of backfill.</li>
</ul>
<p>Including an efficacy endpoint – this allows the trial to include a binary efficacy outcome that is observed at the same time as the toxicity endpoint. Once the MTD has been sufficiently determined further cohorts are allocated to determine the MED (Minimum Effective Dose) as long as that is below the MTD, until the maximum sample size or MED stopping rules have been reached.</p>
<p>Cohort versus Open enrolment: cohort enrolment is the standard way of running a phase 1 trial, a cohort of subjects of pre-determined size are treated at the current dose and the trial pauses until all the subjects in the cohort are complete, then the dose for the next cohort is determined. A phase 1 trial using Open Enrolment recruits ‘all comers’ with a cap on the number of subjects who can be treated but have not yet had a final result. Subjects that arrive whilst this cap has been reached are deemed to be ‘lost’ to the study.</p>
<p>If Open Enrolment and Efficacy Endpoint options are being used together, then subjects who arrive who cannot be allocated to the MTD (because the cap number of subjects awaiting a final result has been reached), can be allocated to the MED (as long as that is below the MTD).</p>
<p>If the trial is analyzing 2 Groups then a joint statistical model is used with options to constrain the group 2 difference in the intercept term to be +ve or -ve, and options as to whether a common or separate estimates of the slope term are used.</p>
<p>If an expansion cohort is included, the this is a single cohort (or one per group, if 2 groups is being used) typically much larger than used during the dose escalation, that is assigned at the end of the study to the target dose. FACTS simulates the results that arise from this cohort and a final analysis.</p>
<p>If open enrolment is being used, the further option to use backfill becomes available. The parameters on this tab for backfill, are to specify the maximum number of subjects that can be allocated for escalation, and the maximum that can be allocated in backfill. These two maximums should not total less than the overall “Max subjects” that can be enrolled. If adding backfill to a trial, usually the previous “Max subjects” becomes the “Max study allocation for escalation”, and an additional sample is allowed for backfill and added to the overall Max subjects.</p>
<p>If the trial has two groups the backfill maximums are the sum of the subjects in the two groups.</p>
<p>For Cohort enrolment, the parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum Study Size, in cohorts: the maximum number of cohorts the trial can use, though designs can include conditions that cause them to stop earlier.</li>
<li>If the trial has two groups, the maximum number of cohorts of the second group.</li>
<li>Cohort size: The number of subjects in each cohort. The maximum sample size for the trial is simply: Max Trial Size (cohorts) * Cohort Size.</li>
<li>Cohort information delay: Normally left at zero, this allows for the trial to be simulated with cohorts recruited more quickly than if waiting for the last cohort to complete before treating the next cohort. This allows the trial to complete in shorter time, but is likely to lead to a larger incidence of toxicities. If the delay is set to 1, the second cohort will be recruited before the results for the first cohort are available, the third cohort will be recruited after the results of the first cohort are available but before the results for the second cohort are available, and so on.</li>
<li>Execution rate: the time taken to recruit, treat and complete the observation of each cohort (in weeks). The value of this parameter does not affect the behavior of the simulations, but it allows a nominal “duration” of each simulation to be calculated. Unlike other FACTS simulations, this duration is not simulated stochastically, it is simply the number of cohorts * this duration. Its purpose is to give a figure to compare with open enrolment designs of the same trial.</li>

<p>If rather than Cohorts, subjects are recruited using open enrolment, the parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Max subjects: the maximum number of subjects who can be recruited into the study.</li>
<li>Time unit – this is a text string that will change the “units” label for time on graphs. This allows data to be more easily entered when the natural time unit is not “weeks”, but “days” or “months”.</li>
<li>Mean recruitment rate: for simulation purposes this is the average number of subjects who will be expected to be available for recruitment during each time period. Recruitment is simulated using a standard Poisson process.</li>
<li>Time until final result: the time for each subject for their final result to become available. This is simulated as a fixed length of time that is the same for all subjects.</li>
<li>Maximum subjects without a final result: the cap on the number of subjects on the current dose or a backfill dose (if backfill is enabled) who can be recruited but not yet completed. This is also known as the ‘maximum queue length’. Subjects arriving and available for recruitment while the number of subjects on this dose who have been treated but have not yet completed is at this maximum, are dropped and assumed no longer available for recruitment. Once the current subjects complete the study has to await further new subjects to become available. There are three caps:
<ul>
<li>Maximum subjects without final results if the dose is uncleared. This allows the design to be cautious when a new dose is used for the first time.</li>
<li>Maximum subjects without final results if dose is cleared and below MTD. This allows a larger number of subjects without final results to be recruited at backfill doses or at the current escalation dose if backfill to the current escalation dose (“frontfilling”) is enabled, or at the MED in the efficacy phase of a trial that includes an efficacy endpoint.</li>
<li>Maximum subjects without final results if dose is cleared and at MTD. This allows us to be more cautious if the model thinks all doses are toxic or if we are allocating at the model MTD and don’t want to expose too many subjects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Backfill – this can be enabled. Backfilling is the allocation of subjects to a dose below the current target dose, if the number of subjects allocated to the current target dose without final results has reached the maximum. Further parameters for backfill are set on the “Backfill” tab under the “Design” tab. On this tab, if backfill is enabled, two sub-maximums can optionally be specified:
<ul>
<li>the maximum number of subjects who can be allocated as part of usual allocation for escalation and MTD determination (and MED if efficacy is included in the trial),</li>
<li>and the maximum number of subjects who can be allocated as part of “backfill”.</li>

<p>Groups: a trial can be analyzed as a “single group” or as “two groups”. If analyzed as a single group, then all subjects are assumed to be the same and treated the same (except for the difference in the dose strength). If analyzed as two groups this allows either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The subjects can be simulated as coming from two similar but distinct groups such as: adults and children, first line or recurrent, having some concomitant treatment or not. The separation into the two groups is based on some property of the subject.</li>
<li>Or the subjects can be simulated as having been allocated (possibly randomized) to one of two versions of the treatment, with the same rang of dose strengths and differing in some other way such as dosing schedule, treatment duration or combination with an additional treatment. The separation of the subjects into the two groups is under the control of the protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case the same analysis options are available (hence we use the generic term “groups” to describe this feature).</p>
<p>If enrolment is by cohort, the there are two separate “maximum study sizes” in cohorts – one for each group.</p>
<p>The Group 2 recruitment, while it overlaps in time with the Group 1 recruitment, is simulated as being in lock-step and the recruitment of the cohort in each group is concurrent and analyzed when both are complete. In the ‘cohorts.csv’ files that are output, the cohort numbers indicates which cohorts were concurrent. The options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To recruit group 1 first then recruit group 2 only when group 1 is complete.</li>
<li>To start recruiting both groups in parallel from the outset.</li>
<li>To start recruiting group 2 once group 1 has reached a specified dose. The first group 2 cohort is recruited in parallel with the next group 1 cohort after the first group1 cohort has been allocated the specified dose (if cohorts can be accrued before the cohort before has completed, the group 2 is accrued too – it does not wait until the group 1 cohort completes unless the next group 1 also waits).</li>
<li>To start recruiting group 2 once group 1 has recruited a specified number of subjects. The first group 2 cohort is recruited in parallel with the next group 1 cohort after the specified number of subjects had been recruited into group 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>If enrolment is open then there are options similar to the cohort enrolment to control when enrolment into group 2 starts:</p>
<ul>
<li>To recruit group 1 first then recruit group 2 only when group 1 is complete.</li>
<li>To start recruiting both groups in parallel from the outset.</li>
<li>To start recruiting group 2 once group 1 has reached a specified dose. The first group 2 subject can be recruited after the first group1 subject has been allocated the specified dose.</li>
<li>To start recruiting group 2 once group 1 has recruited a specified number of subjects. The first group 2 subject can recruited after the specified number of subjects had been recruited into group 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>But in addition the user specifies the maximum number of subjects in Group 2 and how the recruitment is to be simulated:</p>
<ul>
<li>With the group membership a property of the subject – along with a mean recruitment rate for group 2.</li>
<li>With subjects randomized between the two groups (the randomization is fixed at 1:1).</li>
</ul>
<p>The user specifies the three “Maximum subjects without final results …” for the second group.</p>

In both cases ‘1’ is “no-toxicity”, 2 is “mild toxicity” and 3 is the toxicity of interest (from the point of view of defining the MTD, target toxicity band and Overdose Control.

<li>Type of target: this allows the user to specify whether the dose selection targets “the dose who’s estimated toxicity rate is closest to a specified target rate” or “the dose with the highest posterior probability of having a toxicity rate in a target band”. The former is the target rule used in the original CRM papers (<span class="citation" data-cites="o1999two">(<a href="#ref-o1999two" role="doc-biblioref">O’Quigley, Shen, and Gamst 1999</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="de1996incorporating">(<a href="#ref-de1996incorporating" role="doc-biblioref">deMoor et al. 1996</a>)</span>, and the latter rule was introduced in <span class="citation" data-cites="neuenschwander2008critical">(<a href="#ref-neuenschwander2008critical" role="doc-biblioref">Neuenschwander, Branson, and Gsponer 2008</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>Toxicity target (only displayed if the type of target is “a single dose”): this allows the target toxicity rate to be specified and whether the target dose is the one nearest, the one nearest but with a lower rate or the one nearest but with a higher rate.</li>
<li>Target: this panel allows the target toxicity bands to be specified along with overdose control limits. The panel is displayed and enabled even if the target type is “a single dose” to allow overdose control limits to be specified.</li>
<li>Type of Target: controls the selection of the dose for the next cohort – this can be to target a single dose (to replicate the original CRM behavior, see <a href="#sec-study-tox-single">this section</a>) or to target the dose with the highest probability that its toxicity rate lies in a target band.</li>

<section id="sec-study-tox-interval" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-study-tox-interval">Targeting a Toxicity Interval</h3>
<p>Targeting a toxicity band or interval is an innovation introduced with the N-CRM design, unlike other CRM designs that select the dose that is expected to have a toxicity response closest to the desired tolerated limit, the N-CRM selects the dose that has the highest posterior probability of having a toxicity rate in a target toxicity band. This has the advantage of a) having a clearer probability statement and b) having in addition probability statements about the probability of under and overdosing (the toxicity rate being below or above the target toxicity band).</p>
<ul>
<li>The uncertainty in the estimate of toxicity at each dose is expressed by calculating the posterior distribution of the estimate of the rate of toxicity at each dose and calculating the proportion of that distribution that falls in to each of 4 bands of toxicity: ‘Under-dosing’ (toxicity so low that it is likely that a higher dose could be used), ‘Target’ toxicity (we want to select doses whose toxicity rate is most likely to be in this band), ‘Excess’ toxicity (toxicity higher than desired) and ‘Unacceptable’ toxicity.
<ul>
<li>Under-dosing: this band always starts at 0.0; the user specifies the upper bound.</li>
<li>Target band: this band always starts at the upper-bound of the under-dosing band; the user specifies the upper bound.</li>
<li>Excess toxicity: this band always starts at the upper-bound of the target band; the user specifies the upper bound.</li>
<li>Unacceptable toxicity: this band always starts at the upper-bound of the target band, with an upper bound of 1.0. The graph shows the width of the different bands using a simple, fixed, example posterior probability distribution of a toxicity rate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Intervals are relative to control: if a control arm is included in the study, then toxicity bands can be defined as the difference in toxicity rate relative to control. Negative differences (a lower toxicity rate than control) are always treated as under-dosing. To enable this option it is necessary to first go to the Study &gt; Treatment Arms tab and select Include Control.</li>
<li>Limit max excess/unacceptable toxicity: the ‘overdose control’ in terms of a maximum allowed posterior probability that a dose’s toxicity rate lies in either the ‘Excess’ or the ‘Unacceptable’ toxicity bands. Any dose with a posterior probability of having a toxicity rate in either of these two bands that is higher than the specified limit, cannot be selected for allocation to the next cohort, nor selected as MTD at the end of the study (this gives rise to slightly different results compared to those in <span class="citation" data-cites="neuenschwander2008critical">(<a href="#ref-neuenschwander2008critical" role="doc-biblioref">Neuenschwander, Branson, and Gsponer 2008</a>)</span> where the overdose control was not applied to final selection).<br>
</li>
<li>It is possible to have the overdose control limit vary with the number of cohorts allocated. In particular this can be used to reduce the overdose limit as the number of cohorts (and the amount of information) grows. For example for a particular prior and final level of overdose control, it may be that initial escalation is excessively constrained, one way to allow early escalation in this setting is to use these parameters to allow an higher initial overdose control limit and gradually reduce it over time to the final desired limit. Tuning the parameters will require some iteration and simulation. A varying limit is specified by the specifying amount to change the limit by per cohort and the final limit. The amount to change by is always entered as a number in the range (0,1), whether this is an increment or decrement depends on whether the target limit is greater or less than the initial limit. Leaving the change in limit at its default of 0 means the limit does not vary.</li>
<li>Limit max unacceptable toxicity: as for the previous parameter, but here the overdose control is only in terms of the posterior probability that a dose’s toxicity rate lies in the ‘Unacceptable’ toxicity band.</li>
<li>As or the limit on excess/unacceptable toxicity it is possible to have the overdose control limit vary with the number of cohorts, see the description above.</li>
</ul>

<section id="sec-study-tox-single" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-study-tox-single">Targeting a single dose</h3>
<p>It is possible to use the N-CRM design engine with a conventional CRM allocation strategy - to “allocate to the nearest / highest dose below the maximum tolerated toxicity”; this allows conventional CRM design to be simulated with some of the additional features of N-CRM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overdose control</li>
<li>Estimate both parameters of the 2 parameter logistic</li>
<li>The “Recommender” to analyze a specific data set.</li>
</ul>
<p>The target is calculated by:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the MCMC sampling loop finding the dose that meets the target criteria, a doses probability of being the target is then the proportion of times that dose meets the target criteria across the MCMC sampling.</li>
<li>Rather than selecting the dose with the highest probability, the dose at the 50% quantile is used. The cumulative probability of being the target is calculated over the doses in ascending dose strength, and the dose when the cumulative probability passes 50% is selected. This addresses some problems that can arise when very little data is available: that the dose with the highest probability is at one end of the dose range, but that probability is not that high, or that doses are not evenly spaced and a dose close to both its immediate neighbors may never have greater probability than both of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting the Type of Target option to Target a single dose, modifies the tab thus:</p>

<p>Profiles can be specified in 3 different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explicitly: by specifying the toxicity rate to simulate at each dose. This option is only available if the available dose strengths have been specified explicitly, it is not available if a finely spaced dose range defined.</li>
<li>Parametrically: by selecting one of the four models and specifying the parameter values for the model, allowing the toxicity rate to simulate at each dose to be calculated.</li>
<li>Externally: by specifying a file of simulated subject responses at each dose strength, which will be sampled from with replacement when simulating subject responses. As in N-CRM there is a simple, single binary toxicity response per subject and there is no response profile that cannot be specified by the other methods. The mechanism is provided here more for consistency with the other FACTS interfaces.</li>

<p>If the design is using ordinal toxicity, the toxicity response rates can be specified either:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the “Toxicity” tab by specifying the category 3 or greater toxicity rate at each dose and then two offsets – one for the category 2 or greater rate and one for the category 4 rate.</li>
<li>On the “Ordinal Toxicity” tab by separately specifying the toxicity rates for each category of toxicity at each dose.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifying offsets: to ensure that the specified category 3 rate plus the category 2 offset doesn’t sum to more than 1, or the category 3 rate plus the -ve category 4 offset sum to less than 0, the offsets are applied to the logit of the category 3 toxicity rate.</p>
<p>Thus for the category 2+ rate:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<h1>Design</h1>
<p>The Design Tabs allows the user to specify the toxicity response model, efficacy response model if an efficacy endpoint is present, any prior / pseudo patient data, allocation rules, and stopping criteria.</p>
<p>In the N-CRM the toxicity (and efficacy if using) analysis uses the two parameter Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM). The log odds of the probability of toxicity at dose <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is modeled as a simple linear equation using the adjusted dose strength <span class="math inline">\(\hat{x_j}\)</span> of dose <span class="math inline">\(d_j\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
ln(\frac{p_j}{1-p_j}) = \alpha + \beta \hat{x}_j
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Re-arranging:}\ p_j = \frac{e^{\alpha + \beta \hat{x}_j}}{1 + e^{\alpha + \beta \hat{x}_j}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where: <span class="math inline">\(\hat{x}_j = d_j - d^{\ast}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\hat{x}_j = ln(\frac{d_j}{d^{\ast}})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d^{\ast}\)</span> is the <strong>reference dose</strong>, due to this notational convention <span class="math inline">\(\hat{x}̂\)</span>, these transformed dose strengths are referred to as the “X-Hats”.</p>
<p>Note that in either transformation, when <span class="math inline">\(d_j = d^{\ast}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(p_j = \frac{e^{\alpha}}{1 + e^{\alpha}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The prior distribution is a bivariate Normal distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(ln(\beta)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha \\
ln(\beta)
\end{bmatrix}
\sim N
\left(
\begin{bmatrix}
\mu_{\alpha} \\
\mu_{ln(\beta)}
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{\alpha}^2 &amp; \rho \sigma_{\alpha} \sigma_{ln(\beta)} \\
\rho \sigma_{\alpha} \sigma_{ln(\beta)} &amp; \sigma_{ln(\beta)}^2
\end{bmatrix}
\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>With the user supplying the mean and standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \ (\mu_{\alpha}, \sigma_{\alpha})\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(ln(\beta) \ (\mu_{ln(\beta)}, \sigma_{ln(\beta)})\)</span> and the correlation coefficient <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>.</p>
<p>The efficacy model is the same.</p>
<p>Extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are two groups the toxicity or efficacy response of the second is modeled: <span class="math display">\[
ln(\frac{p_j}{1-p_j}) = \alpha + a + \beta b \hat{x}_j
\]</span>
<ul>
<li>Where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(ln(b)\)</span> have their own bi-variate normal prior. Note that as the response of the second group is modelled as an offset from the first an informative prior can be used to limit how large the offset is.</li>
<li>Optionally <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> can be fixed at 1, so the two groups are modelled with a common estimate of the slope (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>)</li>
<li>Optionally a may be constrained to be +ve or -ve so that (if there is a common estimate of the slope) the estimate of the toxicity rate for the second group can be constrained being higher or lower than that of the first group.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>To allow N-CRM to be used to simulate old CRM designs, an option to fix the value of Alpha is included (for both toxicity and efficacy), this option is not recommended for new designs. Fixing the alpha means that the response model has a fixed rate of response at the reference dose – in the old CRM designs in effect the reference dose was above the highest dose.</p>
<p>If the toxicity model is of an ordinal toxicity rate, the toxicity response model is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
logit(Pr(Y \geq j | \hat{x})) = \alpha_j + \beta\hat{x}
\]</span></p>
<p>for ordinal response <span class="math inline">\(j=2,3\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(j = 2,3,4\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_4\)</span> have independent Normal priors and are constrained to be <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_2 &gt; \alpha_3 &gt; \alpha_4\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_3\)</span> is fitted with the BLRM and bivariate Normal prior as for dichotomous toxicity, or it may be given a fixed value.</p>
<p>Lastly both the toxicity and efficacy models can the adjusted to be asymptotic at limits inside the interval <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>. For example if the toxicity being observed has a ‘natural’ background rate then the minimum asymptote could be adjusted to this rate.</p>
<p>If the rate given by the BLRM is <span class="math inline">\(p’_j\)</span> then the actual estimated rate is <span class="math inline">\(p_j\)</span> adjusted to lie between <span class="math inline">\(p^{max}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p^{min}\)</span> where:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p_j = p’_j(p^{max} - p^{min}) + p^{min}
\]</span></p>
<section id="x-hats" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="x-hats">X-Hats</h2>
<p>On this tab the user specifies the reference dose <span class="math inline">\(d^*\)</span> for use in calculating the adjusted dose value (the “x-hat” values). The default value to use is <strong>Median dose is reference</strong>, this uses the median of the dose range for the reference dose, minimizing the correlation in the sampled values of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. Note though that when allocation is restricted to explicit doses it is also recommended that the value of the reference dose is not the same as an actual dose that can be used (at this dose <span class="math inline">\(\hat{x}\)</span> will be 0 and the data on this dose can have undue weight on the estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>).</p>
<p>Different reference doses can easily be used however – between the two doses thought most likely to be MTD, just below the lowest dose, just above the highest dose. The bi-variate Normal prior for <span class="math inline">\((\alpha, ln(\beta))\)</span> will need to be recalibrated to take the change into account.</p>
<p><strong>X-Hats are log(dose strength)</strong> allows the user to select between:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>linear effective dose <span class="math inline">\(\hat{x}_j = d_j - d^*\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(log(\hat{x}_j) = ln(\frac{d_j}{d^*})\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have entered linear dose strengths for the doses (1, 2, 3, 4, … or 100, 150, 200, 250, …) then use the linear effective dose. If however the dose strengths that have been entered are non-linear (12.5, 25, 50, 100, …) but expected to be roughly linear in effect, then use the log of the dose ratio.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-pros-cons-of-using-the-median-dose-as-the-reference-dose">The Pro’s &amp; Con’s of using the median dose as the reference dose</h3>
<p>The reason the median dose is recommended as the reference is that this minimizes the correlation in the fit of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(ln(\beta)\)</span>, the parameters of the BLRM, and it maximises the flexibility of the fit of the model over the dose range.</p>
<p>However care needs to be taken that the prior on <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is not more restrictive than that on <span class="math inline">\(ln(\beta)\)</span> in order to avoid a phenomena observed when preparing tutorials: observing “no toxicities” below the reference dose resulted in a model with increased probability of toxicity above the reference dose compared to observing a toxicity below the reference dose. For a given value of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, higher values of <span class="math inline">\(ln(\beta)\)</span> correspond to lower toxicity below the reference dose – as the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{x}\)</span>̂ values are -ve below the reference dose. The fitted curve thus “pivots” about the value of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> at the reference dose.</p>
<p>There are two solutions to this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>move the reference dose, which involves a choice between two options</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>moving it to the first dose or below (normally allowing a relatively constrained prior around a low value for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>),</li>
<li>or to the highest dose or above (with a relatively uninformative prior).</li>
</ol>
<p>We have seen both solutions perform well against the chosen scenarios – but the choice needs checking and refining with a full range of scenarios that represent the full uncertainty in the true response.</p></li>
<li><p>or modify the priors on <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(ln(\beta)\)</span> making the prior on <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> less informative (in particular increase the probability of low values) and make the prior on <span class="math inline">\(ln(\beta)\)</span> more informative (in particular lower the probability of high values less). Because the prior distribution on <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, is on <span class="math inline">\(ln(\beta)\)</span>, it is easy to make large values of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> more probable than intended.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>If ordinal toxicity is being simulated, it is possible to model the ordinal toxicity, specifying the mean and standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_4\)</span>. These priors are separate from the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(ln(\beta)\)</span> prior, there is no correlation term in the prior. There is the constraint in the model that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_2 &gt; \alpha_3 &gt; \alpha_4\)</span>.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Minimum</strong> and <strong>Maximum</strong> rates that the model is to be fitted too.

For instance if the event being observed has a non-zero background rate (probability of being observed in placebo treated subjects), then the model may fit better if the minimum is set to the lower limit of this expected rate.

For doses where no prior expectation has been specified, the median expected toxicity rate are derived by assuming that the median expected toxicity is linear in log dose on the logit scale, and again a minimally informative unimodal Beta distribution is fitted with the same median.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously and following <span class="citation" data-cites="neuenschwander2008critical">(<a href="#ref-neuenschwander2008critical" role="doc-biblioref">Neuenschwander, Branson, and Gsponer 2008</a>)</span>, the parameters of the bivariate Normal distribution were found using a stochastic fit to the prior expectations of toxicity, minimizing the error in the prior toxicity rates at the 2.5%, 50% and 97.5% quantiles. This is still used in the <strong>All quantiles</strong> and <strong>Legacy prior</strong> cases. However experience with this method with the standard priors (previously called “uninformative”) showed that it yielded priors with too little uncertainty in the <span class="math inline">\(ln(\beta)\)</span>) and too high a value for the correlation parameter for many cases and certainly for the prior to be called “uninformative”.</p></li>
<li><p>Consequently, in the <strong>Quantiles at lowest and highest dose</strong> and <strong>Specific quantiles</strong> cases, the prior is now derived by sampling from the minimally informative unimodal Beta distributions, and fitting the model to each set of sampled toxicity rates.

<p>Clearly in this example the scenarios have a very high correlation between the toxicity at the reference dose (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) and the log gradient (<span class="math inline">\(ln(\beta)\)</span>) giving a high value for the correlation in the prior (<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>). As there are very few scenarios, and they didn’t include extreme cases, the SDs of the priors of parameters will be underestimated.</p>
<p>So In this instance we might round the prior means to 2 decimal places, double the SD of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, slightly increase the SD of <span class="math inline">\(ln(\beta)\)</span> and reduce the correlation to 0.5.</p>
<p>However, it is much better to use Drive from Scenarios after entering a large number of varied and credible scenarios. Indeed is such a collection of scenarios exists, deriving the prior from the scenarios is the simplest approach and often very effective. Only if the performance in the simulations in some scenarios does the prior need re-visiting (usually to slightly increase the <span class="math inline">\(ln(\beta)\)</span> SD and/or reduce the correlation).</p>
<p>We strongly recommend checking the performance of the prior across a wide range of scenarios, and of entering the reported derived values of the fitted prior as an explicit prior and then manually modifying them in the light of the model’s performance on the various scenarios.</p>

<p>This option allows “prior data” or “pseudo data” to be specified that will be included in every analysis.

<p>The user selects which dose levels at which to include the data and specifies the number of pseudo/prior subjects/observations and the number of toxicities. These are allowed to be fractional, and observations can be at dose levels not being tested in the trial. In each analysis the observed data is augmented with this specified data and the parameters of the toxicity response estimated.</p>
<p>If there is an efficacy endpoint as well as toxicity endpoint, pseudo subject data is specified separately for the two endpoints (not surprisingly!). If the data is to be analyzed as “2 groups” pseudo subject data is also specified separately for the two groups.</p>
<p>The effect of this data on the prior can be visualized by the “Update Plot” function that estimates the parameters of the toxicity response and plots the curves of 100 samples drawn from the posterior estimates of the parameters of the model.</p>

<section id="allocation-rules" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="allocation-rules">Allocation Rules</h2>
<p>The Allocation Rule sub-tab is depicted below (<a href="#fig-sec-des-tox-prior-alloc1" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;50</a>); it allows the user to select and set the parameters for the allocation rules.</p>
<p>There is an option to mimic the original Neuenschwander paper and rely on just the toxicity model and the overdose control to guide allocation – i.e.&nbsp;allocate to as close to the estimate of the MTD as we can limited only by the overdose control limits. This is “Use only overdose control”. Normally however we think the clinical will want to impose additional allocation rules.</p>
<p>The next dose allocated is a combination of the current target dose, and 2 possible maximum allocatable doses:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The target dose is the dose with the highest probability of being the target: the dose with the greatest estimated probability that its toxicity rate lies in the target toxicity band, or the dose nearest or highest below the MTD depending on the options selected on the Study &gt; Toxicity tab.</p></li>
<li><p>The highest dose that meets the overdose criteria (if any): the highest dose that does not have a posterior probability that its toxicity rate lies in the excess &amp; unacceptable toxicity bands or unacceptable toxicity bands above the threshold specified on the Study &gt; Toxicity tab.</p></li>
<li><p>The current cleared dose and how far above that dose can be allocated to as defined by the specified allocation rules (if any).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The next dose to be allocated to is the lowest of these 3 doses.</p>
<p>It is possible to specify a “run-in” phase before this dose escalation phase applies. A run-in phase has a fixed sequence of doses and cohort sizes (typically smaller than the cohort size used in the escalation phase) and lasts up to the first observed toxicity or the end of the sequence of doses.</p>

<p>If the user selects to use an “Initial run-in” then there are 3 run-in types that can be selected from:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Simple run” (the only type available before FACTS 6.3): cohorts are of a single size and the dose sequence up to the “Run-in cannot go beyond” dose (if specifed) is either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>at every dose starting at the specified “initial dose” if explicit doses have been defined on the the Study &gt; Treatment Arms tab,</p></li>
<li><p>at the dose increment intervals defined in the allocation rules if finely spaced doses have been defined on the Study &gt; Treatment Arm tab.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“Custom run-in” where the user specifies which doses are selected (leaving the “number of subjects” at a dose at 0 mans it is not selected) and at each dose how many subjects are allocated in the cohort at that dose.</p></li>
<li><p>Small cohort pre-escalation, cohorts are of a single size and the dose sequence follows the dose increment intervals defined in the allocation rules up to the “Run-in cannot go beyond” dose (if specifed).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“Simple run-in” and “Small cohort pre-escalation” the user specifies the “small cohort size” and there is an option to specify a top dose that the “Run-in cannot go beyond”.</p>
<p>For all run-in schemes there are options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>End run-in on 1st category 2 toxicity: The default for the simulation is to stop the run-in when the first full toxicity is observed, there is an option to instead stop when a lower grade toxicity is observed – a category 2 toxicity. If this option is selected, the simluation of virtual subjects is extended to include the simulation of category 2 tocxicity as well as category 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Include run-in subjects in overall maximum</p></li>
<li><p>When run-in ends expand last cohort to full size</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If this <strong><em>is not</em></strong> set then N-CRM model is applied and the next cohort is allocated as close to the target as possibly, restricted by the overdose restrictions and not allocating any higher than the dose reached in the run-in.</p></li>
<li><p>If this option <strong><em>is</em></strong> set then last allocated small cohort is treated as the start of a full cohort and the remaining subjects are allocated at the same dose. The N-CRM model is then applied and the next cohort allocated according to the overdose restrictions and allocation rules. [Note it is possible that after observing no toxicities in the run-in or in the expanded cohort, that the overdose control will force a de-escalation in dose, depending on the priors for the model parameters and the overdose control limits]</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If simulating 2 groups, and a run-in is specified, group 2 will only use a run-in if on the Study tab the option “Recruit Group 1 and Group 2 together” has been selected. Otherwise only group 1 will use the specified run-in, once group 2 starts it starts with the full cohort (or if open enrollment is being used, the full number of subjects to clear the dose). If using a run-in and recruiting groups 1 and 2 together then both use the same run-in rules, and both will stop on the first toxicity regardless of which group the toxicity occurs in.</p>
<p>If used, the Allocation rules have the effect of setting a Highest Allocatable Dose that specifies the highest dose level that can be allocated to by the allocation rules.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At the start the Highest Allocatable Dose is the user specified <strong>Starting dose level.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>A dose is not ‘cleared’ until ‘<strong>The minimum cohorts on/near a dose before cleared’</strong> have been allocated to it. If this is set to greater than one, then the specified number of cohorts must have been allocated to the current dose before it is ‘cleared’. Typically this parameter would be set &gt; 1 when small cohort sizes are being used (such as 1 or 2 subjects per cohort) and/or when cohorts are assigned before a previous cohort’s results are available.</p>
<p>If using Open enrolment, this parameter is ’<strong>The minimum subjects on a dose before cleared’</strong> and refers to the number of <em>complete</em> subjects.</p></li>
<li><p>The user can specify that <strong>Dose not cleared if proportion toxic on dose &gt;</strong> and a maximum level of toxicity that can be tolerated for the current dose to be ‘cleatred’. This is of course somewhat of a ‘belt and braces’ approach – it being likely that the model would not want to increment if the proportion of toxicity is high, and indeed if an undesired behavior is observed in simulations, the behavior of the model and the effect of the prior should be investigated.</p></li>
<li><p>The user specifies whether the dose increment rules are to be specified in terms of the number of dose levels that can be incremented or in terms of the ratio by which the dose strength can be increased. If using “dose strength” it is up to the user to ensure that the specified ratio is sufficient to allow all doses to be reached. For example if in the dose range there is a dose of strength 100 and the next dose is of strength 200, then if any dose increment rule is specified that doesn’t allow the dose strength to at least double (using “ratio of dose strength” of less than 2) then the rule will prevent escalation from the 100 dose to the 200 dose.</p></li>
<li><p>The maximum amount the dose can be incremented can be specified in 3 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Single value</strong>: For all doses, once a dose has been cleared the next ‘highest allocatable dose’ is the dose above the cleared dose by the specified increment – either a number of dose levels or by a proportion of the dose strength.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>By total number of toxicities:</strong> With this rule the maximum dose increase allowed depends on the total number of toxicities that have been observed in the trial so far. The user specifies the maximum increment (in terms of the number of dose levels or the maximum proportional increase in dose strength) when no toxicities, one toxicity, or more than one toxicity has been observed.</p></li>

<p>When a fine grained dose range is being used, the specification of the allocation rules change to accommodate the fact that the trial is no longer stepping up a few pre-defined dose levels.

<li><p>The user can specify that <strong>Dose not cleared if ppn toxic on/near dose &gt;</strong> and a maximum level of toxicity that can be tolerated before the dose is cleared. This is of course somewhat of a ‘belt and braces’ approach – it being likely that the model would not want to increment if the proportion of toxicity is high, and indeed if an undesired behavior is observed in simulations, the behavior of the model and the effect of the prior should be investigated.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Max ratio of dose strengths considered as near</strong> or <strong>Delta in dose strength considered as near</strong> defines a margin such that when evaluating whether a dose that has been allocated to counts as “cleared”, then cohorts allocated within that margin all count as being “on” the dose to allow incrementing.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Maximum increment selected by</strong> option allows the user to specify varying maximum increments either dependent on the current cleared dose (<strong>Dose strength</strong>), or on the <strong>Total number of toxicities</strong> that have been observed, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single value</strong>: the amount by which the highest allocatable dose can be above the current cleared doses is constant throughout the trial. (This simple rule can work well when combined with overdose control. The two more complex rules are essentially trying to achieve the same thing as overdose control but are more simplistic and it may be confusing as to whether the allocation rule or overdose control is preventing escalation at any given moment).</li>
<li><strong>Total number of toxicities:</strong> the amount by which the highest allocatable dose is above the current cleared dose is specified separately for whether zero, one or two or more toxicities have been observed in the entire study.</li>
<li><strong>Dose strength</strong>: The user specifies:
<ul>
<li>the increment at low doses;</li>
<li>the increment at medium doses, along with the upper and lower dose strengths that define the bounds of what constitutes a ‘medium dose’; and</li>
<li>the increment at high doses.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If toxicities are observed that causes the N-CRM to allocate a dose below the current cleared dose, then there are two options for what happens to the current cleared dose:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is left unchanged and further increments are applied relative to the <strong>Highest cleared dose.</strong></li>
<li>it is reduced to the dose level selected by N-CRM, and further increments are applied relative to the <strong>Most recently</strong> <strong>cleared dose</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If a Control arm has been included, the user must specify the number of subjects per cohort to be allocated to Control. (The Control arm will never be the MTD and thus whole cohorts will never be assigned to it, so it must have a fixed number of subjects assigned from each cohort).</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-stopping-criteria">Stopping Criteria</h2>
<p>The simulation will always stop when the maximum number of cohorts or subjects has been allocated.</p>
<p>The user may also specify that the study may stop early in terms of the amount of information that has been gathered about the target dose. In the N-CRM, the target dose can either be the Maximum Tolerated Dose or the “the allowed dose that has the highest posterior probability of having a toxicity rate in the Target Toxicity Band”; we use the label MTD (Maximum Target toxicity Dose) for this target dose too, for brevity and familiarity from previous CRM methods.</p>
<p>Note: if overdose limits have been set (see <a href="#sec-studyinfo">this section</a>), then doses with posterior probabilities of having a toxicity rate in the Excess Toxicity or Unacceptable Toxicity bands that are greater than the specified thresholds, are disallowed for <strong>both</strong> dose allocation <strong>and</strong> selection as MTD.</p>
<p>To enable early stopping, the user must select “Rules for stopping trial early” there are then 2 rules which if selected are always “AND”ed together, and a further block of rules, the result of which (if specified) are “AND”ed with the first two rules. If more than one rule is selected within the block these may be either logically “AND”ed together or “OR”ed together to give the result of the rules in the block.</p>
<p>The two first standalone rules are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If a “Required number of cohorts/subjects near MTD” rule is set then the trial will only stop early if at least this number of cohorts or subject has been allocated to the MTD dose or nearby doses. In the box above the “Count as MYD doses differing from MTD by less than or equal” allows how far away a dose can be and for cohorts/subjects on those doses to count towards this total. This can be set to 0 to count only cohorts/subjects on the MTD. It is provided for when fine grain dosing or a large number of explicit doses have been specified. If specified this rule this must always be met along with any other rules set for the trial to stop early.</p></li>
<li><p>If a “Minimum number of cohorts/subjects accrued” has been set then this specifies a lower limit on the sample size before early stopping is allowed. It is provided to allow a higher number of subjects on the MTD if one of the first doses appears to be the MTD. If specified this rule this must always be met along with any other rules set for the trial to stop early.</p></li>

Figure&nbsp;56: Design - Stopping Criteria sub tab
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The available stopping rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Required number of cohorts/subjects on/near MTD</strong>: Once the specified number of cohorts has been allocated to the dose currently determined to be the MTD, the trial may stop.</p>
<ul>
<li>This limit is defined in subjects if open enrollment rather than cohort enrolment is being used.</li>
<li>The required number of cohorts/subjects can be “near” (rather than “on”) the MTD if a “Count as MTD” interval is defined. This interval is either defined by an interval of “dose strength” using the dose strengths defined on the Study &gt; Treatment Arms tab, or by an interval of “dose strength ratios”. Which is used will correspond to the Selection for “Dose allocation rules apply to” on the Allocation Rules tab. A difference of 0, or factor of 1 can be used to only count cohorts/subjects actually on the selected MTD dose.</li>
<li>If open enrolment is being used, there is an option to only pause accrual not stop it when the stopping rules have been met, in case the final results of any subjects that were not complete at the time the stopping rules were met cause the rules to be no longer met (for example by having results that change the dose estimated to be the MTD). If this option is selected then the stopping rules are re-assessed when all the current subjects are complete and the trial resumed if the rules are no longer met. Note this option is not required for cohort enrolment as stopping rules are only evaluated between cohorts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Minimum cohorts/subjects accrued</strong>: this rule ensures that a minimum overall number of cohorts have been tested before the trial is allowed to stop. It makes no sense to use this rule on its own (it would effectively just lower the overall study cap) it should only be used in conjunction with other stopping rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>This limit is defined in subjects if open enrollment rather than cohort enrolment is being used.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Additional Stopping Rules</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Range/Ratio of dose strengths within the credible interval is less than or equal to</strong>: This is only enabled if on the Study &gt; Study Info tab, the Type of Target has been set to “Target a single dose”. In this case the credible interval of the dose range that might contain the MTD is calculated, and this option allows the user to specify the width of the credible interval in “dose strength” to consider. How this works is a little counter intuitive: in each MCMC sample the engine determines which dose is the MTD and each doses’ Pr(MTD) is the proportion of the samples it was the MTD. The engine then calculates the minimum range of dose strengths required so that the sum of Pr(MTD) of the doses in the range exceeds 1 – Alpha. (So if a single dose has Pr(MTD) &gt; 1-Alpha, the CI has zero width). If the xhats are log(dose strength) then the minimum range of log(dose strength) is found and exp() of this range returned.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The stopping rule is met if the width of the CI returned is less than that specified by the user.</p></li>
<li><p>If fine grain dosing is being used then the width of the target credible interval is defined as a dose strength ratio rather than a number of doses.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Stop if adding another DLT free cohort does not alter the MTD</strong>: this rule is evaluated by analyzing the existing data supplemented by an additional cohort of a specified size where all the responses are no-toxicity; if this results in no change in selection of MTD then this stopping rule is met. If the study is using Open Enrolment, the user additionally specifies the size of the ‘virtual’ cohort to use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Probability of dose being in the target band greater than</strong>: in order to stop, the MTD’s posterior probability that its toxicity rate lies in the Target Toxicity band must be at or above the required threshold.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maximum Cohorts/Subjects near MTD</strong>: this option is supplied for use if the additional stopping rules are being OR’d together. (When they are AND’d together it simply functions the same way as the “Required Cohorts on MTD and stopping will not occur until the higher of the two targets is met).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Join condition:</strong> if more than one additional stopping rule is selected, whether only any one of them needs to be met for the trial to be able to stop (Join condition = “OR”), of if all of the selected rules need to be met for the trial to be able to stop (Join condition = “AND”).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The study will also be stopped if there are no allowed doses by the overdose rules. However this <em>can</em> occur early in the study if a toxicity is observed in the first or second cohort. It is likely that in practice the clinical team would override the design stopping the study. Whilst it is difficult to fully represent the team’s decision making, a simple rule is included that is intended to approximate it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum toxicities required before stopping</strong>: This allows a requirement to be specified to observe a ‘minimum number of toxicities’ before the trial stops. If no doses are allowed by the overdosing rules, cohorts are assigned to the lowest dose until the minimum number of toxicities are observed, the stopping rules are met, or doses become allowable again after the model is updated after seeing no toxicities.</li>

<p>If an additional efficacy endpoint is used, the MTD stopping criteria refer to when the trial jumps from assigning subjects with the aim of finding the MTD (“MTD phase”) to assigning subjects with the aim of finding the MED (“MED phase”). In the MED phase, it is possible that because of new data being observed, the MTD stopping rules are no longer met and the trial switches back to the MTD phase. A new stopping rule for the MTD phase is added, “<strong>Maximum subjects used to determine the MTD</strong>”. After this number of subjects has been enrolled, the trial switches from MTD to MED phase and there is no going back.</p>
<p>In the MED phase, there are several rules for stopping early (i.e.&nbsp;before the maximum sample size of the trial):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Maximum cohorts/subjects on MED</strong>. This behaves analogous to <strong>Required number of cohorts/subjects on/near MTD</strong> in the MTD stopping rules, with the exception of not using a concept of “near” doses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Number of doses within the credible interval is less than or equal to</strong> with the sub-option <strong>Alpha for width of credible interval.</strong> This behaves analogous to <strong>Range/Ratio of dose strengths within the credible interval is less than or equal to</strong> in the MTD stopping rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Probability of dose being MED greater than.</strong> This behaves analogous to <strong>Probability of dose being in the target band greater than</strong> in the MTD stopping rules<strong>.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>A special case arises when the MED estimate is larger than the MTD estimate. If that is the case, subjects are allocated to MTD or the highest cleared dose (whatever is smaller) even in the MED phase. The option “<strong>If MED &gt; MTD: Continue until subjects near MTD reach</strong>” specifies how many subjects should be assigned to MTD in the MED phase before stopping the trial (and therefore giving up hope that the MED is a safe dose).</p>

<p>N.B. FACTS uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in the generation of simulated patient response data and trial results. In order to exactly reproduce a statistical set of results, it is necessary to start the Markov Chain from an identical “Random Seed”. The initial random seed for FACTS simulations is set from the simulation tab, the first thing that FACTS does is to draw the random number seeds to use at the start of each simulation. It is possible to re-run a specific simulation, for example to have more detailed output files generated, by specifying ‘start at simulation’.</p>
<p>Say the 999th simulation out of a set displayed some unusual behavior, in order to understand why, one might want to see the individual interim analyses for that simulation (the “weeks” file), the sampled subject results for that simulation (the “Subjects” files) and possibly even the MCMC samples from the analyses in that simulation. You can save the .facts file with a slightly different name (to preserve the existing simulation results), then run 1 simulation of the specific scenario, specifying that the simulations start at simulation 999 and that at least 1 weeks file, 1 subjects file and the MCMC samples file (see the “MCMC settings” dialog) are output.</p>
<p>Even a small change in the random seed will produce different simulation results.</p>
<p>By default he same random number seed is used at the start of the simulation of each scenario. If two identical scenarios are specified then identical simulation results will be obtained. The same may happen if scenarios or designs only differ in ways that have no impact on the trials being simulated, for instance designs that have no adaptation, or scenarios that don’t trigger any adaptation (e.g.&nbsp;none of the simulations stop early). To avoid this possible artificial correlation in results across scenarios, select the “Different seed” option.</p>
<p>The user can specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of simulations for which ‘Cohorts’ files are written. ‘Cohorts’ files record the data, analysis and recommendation at each interim (after each cohort).</li>
<li>The parallelization packet size, this allows simulation jobs to be split into runs of no-more than the specified number of trials to simulate. If more simulations of a scenario are requested than can be done in one packet, the simulations are started as the requisite number of packets and the results combined and summarized when they are all complete – so the final results files look just as though all the simulations were run as one job or packet. When running simulations on the local machine FACTS enterprise version will process as many packets in parallel as there are execution threads on the local machine. The overhead of packetization is quite low so a packet size of 10 to 100 can help speed up the overall simulation process – threads used to simulate scenarios that finish quicker can pick up packets for scenarios that take longer, if the number of scenarios is no directly divisible by the number of threads packetization uses all threads until the last few packets have to be run and finally the “Simulations complete” figure can be updated at the end of each packet, so the smaller the packet the better FACTS can report the overall progress.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-simulation-with-variants">Simulation with Variants</h2>
<p>The only difference that specifying design variants (see <a href="#sec-variants">this section</a>) introduces is to create additional scenarios – one for each Virtual Subject Response (VSR) profile for each variant. For example if there were 5 VSR profiles and then 4 variants (different numbers of maximum cohorts) specified then would now be 20 scenarios in total. The scenario names have “_Var1”, “_Var2”, … appended to them. Once simulations have been run and the .facts file has been saved and re-opened the scenarios are listed in alphabetical order.</p>

Within the “_results” folder there will be a sub-folder that holds the results for each scenario.</p>

<section id="sec-how-many-simulations-to-run" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-how-many-simulations-to-run">How many simulations to run?</h2>
<ul>
<li>After first entering a design it is worth running just a small number of simulations such as 10 to check that the scenarios and design have been entered correctly. If all 10 simulations of a ‘null’ scenario are successful, or all 10 simulations of what was intended to be an effective drug scenario are futile, it is likely there has been a mistake or misunderstanding in the specification of the scenarios or the final evaluation or early stopping criteria.</li>
<li>Once the design and scenarios look broadly correct, it is usually worth quickly collecting rough estimates of the operating characteristics using around 100 simulations for each scenario. 100 simulations is enough to spot designs having very poor operating characteristics such as very high type-1 error, very poor power, a strong tendency to stop early for the wrong reason, or poor probability of selecting the correct target. 100 simulations is also usually sufficient to spot problems with the data analysis such as poor model fits and significant bias in the posterior estimates.</li>
<li>Typically 1,000 simulations of each scenario of interest is required to get estimates of the operating characteristics precise enough to compare designs and tune the parameters. (Very roughly rates of 5% (such as type-1 error) can be estimated to about +/-1.5% and rates of around 80% (such as power) estimated +/- 2.5%)</li>
<li>Finally around 10,000 simulations of the scenarios of interest is required to give confidence in operating characteristics of a design and possibly to select between the final shortlisted designs (Approximately rates of 5% can be estimated to about +/-0.5% and rates of around 80% estimated +/- 1%). This degree of accuracy usually unnecessary for dose escalation designs.</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be many operating characteristics need to be compared over a number of scenarios, such as expected sample size, type-1 error, power, probability of selecting a good dose as the target and quality of estimation of the dose-response.</p>
<p>However frequently these will be compared over a range of scenarios, it may not be necessary to run very large number of simulations for each scenario if a design shows a consistent advantage on the key operating characteristics over the majority of the scenarios.</p>

<p>The first two values specify two standard MCMC parameters –</p>
<ul>
<li>The length of burn-in is the number of the initial iterations whose results are discarded, to allow the sampled values to settle down.</li>
<li>The number of samples is the number of subsequent iterations whose results are recorded in order to give posterior estimates of the values of interest (in this case α and β).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Number of samples per imputation</strong> value only applies to analyses using imputed data from a longitudinal model and is irrelevant for N-CRM, hence it is greyed out.</p>
<p>If the <strong>Number of MCMC files to output</strong> value is set to N, where N &gt; 0, then all the sampled values at each interim in the first N simulations are output, allowing the user to check convergence.</p>
<p><strong>The MCMC output thinning parameter</strong> can be used to reduce the amount of data output to the MCMC file. It does not reduce the amount of MCMC samples used within the model fitting.</p>
<p>To obtain the MCMC sampled values for a particular simulation, keep the same Random number seed and use <strong>Start at simulation</strong> to specify the simulation in question and run just 1 simulation.</p>

<p>If you have access to a computational grid, you may choose to have your simulations run on the grid instead of running them locally. This frees your computer from the computationally intensive task of simulating so you can continue other work or even shutdown your PC or laptop. In order to run simulations on the grid, it must first be configured, this is normally done via a configuration file supplied with the FACTS installation by the IT group responsible for the FACTS installation.</p>

<p>The default location for the aggregated files is the results directory for the study, but this can be changed.</p>
<p>Aggregation may be performed with or without pivoting on group, or both.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unpivoted files will have one row for each row in the original files.</li>
<li>In pivoted files each original row will be split into one row per dose, plus two extra rows for ‘below lowest’ and ‘above highest’.
<ul>
<li>Where there is a group of columns for each dose, they will be turned into a single column with each value on a new row.</li>
<li>If there is no value for the below lowest or above highest rows, they will be left blank.</li>
<li>Values in columns that are independent of group will be repeated on each row.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The default is to aggregate all scenarios, but any combination may be selected.</p>
<p>Pressing “Aggregate” generates the aggregated files.</p>
<p>Each type of csv file is aggregated into a separate csv file whose name begins <code>agg_</code> or <code>agg_pivot_</code>, so <code>agg_summary.csv</code> will contain the rows from each of the <code>summary.csv</code> files, unpivoted. <code>cohortsNNN.csv</code> files are aggregated into a single <code>agg_[pivot_]cohorts.csv</code> file. <code>Doses.csv</code> is identical for all scenarios and so is not aggregated.</p>

<h1>Per Scenario Graphs of Simulation Results</h1>
<p>To enable swift visualization and analysis of the simulation results, FACTS has a number of pre-defined graphs it can display. Full and detailed simulation results are available in ‘csv’ format files that can be loaded into other analysis tools allowing any aspect of the simulation to be explored. These files are described in Section 0, below.</p>
<p>To view the graphs, select a row of scenario results by clicking on it and then click on the ‘View Graph’ button and select “Show Per Scenario Graphs”.</p>
<p>Below we have shown full screen shots of the graphs in the graph manager, but the graph display supports copying just the graph to the clipboard, to facilitate pasting them into documents and presentations. Right clicking on a graph brings up a short menu that allows the image of the graph to be copied to the clipboard or saved in ‘png’ format to a file. Here is an example image:</p>

Figure&nbsp;76: Allocation and toxicity history plot
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This graph shows the allocation and toxicity history for an individual simulation. Each dot represents a subject, the dot is colored red if toxicity was observed, grey otherwise. The subjects’ outcomes are displayed left to right in the order in which they were dosed, and at a height corresponding to the dose they were given.</p>
<p>The graph includes a drop down selector box allowing the user to select which simulated trial is displayed. A history can only be displayed for trials for which a ‘cohorts’ file has been written out.</p>
<p>There is an option to show “the truth”, which if selected (the default) colors the background according to the simulated toxicity rate of the dose strength on the y-axis. Thus the background has bands of color for “under-dosing”, “target”, “excess” and “unacceptable” toxicity.</p>
<p>On the left hand side, a black triangle next to the y-axis indicates the highest cleared dose. Green/red triangles show the Model MTD/MED+ and finally the selected MTD/MED.</p>
<p>If the trial uses open enrolment this graph is slightly changed.</p>

<p>The data can be entered directly in the data grid – each row containing the date for a single subject.</p>
<p>The format of the grid is the same as though viewing the “subject.csv” file in a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>For historical reasons the data file format contains 5 columns that are now unused but have been retained. Thus the columns are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First column is the subject ID. This column can be left blank, FACTS does not used the value, it is there to allow the data to be cross-referenced to an external data source. If not required there is no harm simply entering ‘1’ on each row.</p></li>
<li><p>The next 5 columns are unused and can be left blank. Do not enter text containing comma’s in these fields, these will be read as column separators if the data is saved and read back in.</p></li>
<li><p>Cohort number, this should be an integer indicating which cohort the subject belonged to (and hence the order in which they entered the trial). This data is sometimes used when determining what doses the allocation rules permit to be used. The FACTS GUI now checks to ensure that this value has been entered.</p></li>
<li><p>Dose Strength, if explicit doses are being used this value must match the dose strength of one of the doses defined on the ‘Treatment Arms’ tab – as the dose escalation rules are defined in terms of “number of doses”. If doses have been defined using ‘finely spaced doses’ then this column can contain any value as dose escalation rules defined using “dose strength”. The value entered will be used as the strength of the dose the subject was administered.</p>
<p>Apart from the requirement that the dose strength corresponds to one of the planned doses if the design uses explicit doses, there is no need for the data entered to represent a dose escalation permitted by the design. The team can have been more or less cautious, and there can be more or less data, than originally planned.</p></li>
<li><p>Toxicity – if a binary endpoint is being used this must be 0 (not-toxicity) or 1 (toxicity), if Ordinal toxicity is being used then this must be 1, 2, 3 or 4; where 1 is now no toxicity, 2 mild toxicity, 3 toxicity, and 4 severe toxicity.</p></li>
<li><p>Efficacy – this must be 0 (no efficacy) or 1 (efficacy), even if efficacy is not being modelled in the design. If it is not being modelled then whether the value is 0 or 1 is immaterial.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="loading-data-from-a-file">Loading Data From a File</h2>
<p>As well as entering the data via FACTS its possible to load the data from a ‘subject.csv’ file. These can be cerated within FACTS or outside of FACTS and once created can be edited FACTS or outside of FACTS.</p>
<p>We have tried to make it particularly easy to enter, modify and analyze data in N-CRM because this is a useful way to explore the properties of the design in addition to simulation.</p>
<section id="the-subject.csv-file-format" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-subject.csv-file-format">The subject.csv file format</h3>
<p>The file is a simple ascii file with the different data items separated by commas. Any line starting with ‘#’’ is ignored, here we use that to include a header row. The data may also include spaces to aid readability (but <strong>not</strong>, currently, tabs). Each line defines the dose given to a single subject and that subject’s response.</p>
<p>For historic reasons the CRM subject.csv file format includes fields for patient identification data, however the FACTS design engine does not use this data, but does require that the columns contain data of the expected format. This is the first 6 columns: patient ID, Patient Initials, Year, Month, Day, Time &amp; Cohort. The simplest thing to do is enter simple default values as shown below.</p>
<p>#Patient ID, Patient Initials, Year, Month, Day, Time, Cohort, Dose, Toxicity, Efficacy<br>
1, , , , , , 1, 12.5, 0, 0<br>
In FACTS only the last four columns are ever significant: Cohort, Dose, Toxicity and Efficacy. “Dose” needs to contain the <strong>dose level</strong> (<strong>not</strong> the dose index)) of the dose given to the subject, For example if the dose levels were specified as 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 so this column should contain one of these values.</p>
<p>If the toxicity endpoint is dichotomous then “Toxicity” needs to contain either a ‘1’ (to indicate toxicity observed) or a ‘0’ (for no toxicity). If its ordinal, then it needs to contain a ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’ or ‘4’ corresponding to the observed level of toxicity for that subject, where ‘1’ is now “no toxicity’ and ‘3’ is the ‘target toxicity’, ‘2’ is ‘mild toxicity’ and ‘4’ is ‘severe toxicity’.</p>
<p>A value in the final “Efficacy” column is also required whether or not efficacy is being modelled in the design. The column should contain either a ‘1’ (to indicate efficacy observed) or a ‘0’ (for no efficacy).</p>
<p>Thus if the first cohort had been allocated the lowest dose ’12.5’ and no subjects experienced toxicity (‘0’), the subjects.csv file looks like this:</p>
<p>#Patient ID, Patient Initials, Year, Month, Day, Time, Cohort, Dose, Tox, Efficacy<br>
1, , , , , , 1, 12.5, 0, 0<br>
1, , , , , , 1, 12.5, 0, 0<br>
1, , , , , , 1, 12.5, 0, 0</p>

<p>Buttons that allow the subject data file to be changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>’Select File to Create New Analysis: launches a file browser that allows the user to select a new “.csv” file from any location. The selected file is copied to the “_Results” folder (retaining its current name) and made the current subject data file.</li>
<li>‘Rename Current Analysis’ allows the name of the current subject data file to be changed.</li>
<li>‘Select Difference Analysis’ allows a different subject data file that is in the “_Results” folder to be made the current subject data file.</li>
<li>‘Delete Analysis’ allows any of the subject data files that are in the “_Results” folder to be deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The name of the current subject data file and the name of the corresponding analysis folder are shown below the subject data file buttons.</p>
<p>There are five buttons that allow the currently loaded subject data file to be modified:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Delete Row’ deletes the currently selected row in the data grid. The data in the current subject file is not updated unless the current data is saved.</li>
<li>‘Delete All’ clears all the data in the data grid. The data in the current subject file is not updated unless the current data is saved.</li>
<li>‘Reload data’ replaces the data in the data grid with the data that is still in the current subject data file.</li>
<li>‘Save As’ saves the current data in the data grid to a new subject data file in the “_Results” folder, and makes that the current subject data file.</li>
<li>“Save” saves the current data in the data grid to the current subject data file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Running an analysis performs a ‘Save’ before running the analysis.</p>

<p>The available analysis parameters are</p>
<ul>
<li>MCMC Burn-in: how many of the initial MCMC samples are discarded before accumulating samples to estimate the posterior distributions of the values of interest.</li>
<li>Number of samples: the number of MCMC samples to take in-order to estimate the posterior distributions of the values of interest.</li>
<li>Random Seed: the seed to be used initialize the random number sequence, with the same design data and random seed FACTS will return the same results.</li>
<li>Edit command parameters. This allows the command line string to the design engine to modified, this is an advanced option. The command line options are described in the “FACTS DE User Guide for Trial Execution”.</li>

<h1>Output Files</h1>
<p>FACTS stores the results of simulations as ‘.csv’ files under a Results folder. For each row in the simulations table, there is a folder named by the toxicity response profile, which contains the corresponding ‘.csv’ files.</p>
<p>These files can be opened using Microsoft Excel, but versions of Excel before 2007 are restricted to 256 columns, which is too few to view some files in their entirety. OpenOffice Calc will show all the columns (and will allow you to open two files that have the same name at the same time!). Because Excel takes out a file lock on any file it has open, while a file is open in Excel it cannot be deleted or modified by another application. The most common cause for an error to be reported when simulating trials in FACTS is because the user has one of the previous results files is still open in Excel.</p>
<p>There are several types of file:</p>
<p><strong>Summary.csv</strong> contains a single row of data that holds data summarized across the simulations. This is the source of most of the values in the simulations table.</p>
<p><strong>Simulations.csv</strong> contains one row per simulation describing the final state of each simulation for every trial simulated.</p>
<p><strong>CohortsNNN.csv</strong> contains one row for each cohort during a simulation where NNN is the number of the simulation. By default this file is written only for the first 100 simulations, but this can be changed via the advanced button on the simulation tab. The values in the last row of the cohorts file will be the same as the final values for that simulation in the simulations file.</p>
<section id="contents-of-summary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contents-of-summary">Contents of summary.csv</h2>
<p>The columns in summary.csv are common across all the FACST Dose Finding design engines.</p>
<p>Some columns are only output if certain options are being used:</p>
<p>Efficacy Only These columns are output only if an efficacy endpoint is simulated as well as the toxicity endpoint.</p>
<p>Open Enrolment Only These columns are output only if open enrolment is being simulated rather than cohort enrolment.</p>
<p>Cohort Expansion Only These columns are output only of an expansion cohort is being simulated.</p>
<p>MTD only These columns are output only if the target dose for the toxicity endpoint is a single MTD, rather than the dose most likely to have a toxicity rate in the target toxicity band.</p>
<p>If 2 groups are being simulated, then there are two separate summary files. The first summary file “summary.csv” contains the results for the first group, the second summary file “summary2.csv” contains the result for the second group.</p>

<p>Most of the columns are common to the two file types, but the first few are different.</p>
<p>As with the summary.csv file, some columns are only output if certain options are being used:</p>
<p>Efficacy Only These columns are output only if an efficacy endpoint is simulated as well as the toxicity endpoint.</p>
<p>Open Enrolment Only These columns are output only if open enrolment is being simulated rather than cohort enrolment.</p>
<p>Cohort Expansion Only These columns are output only of an expansion cohort is being simulated.</p>
<p>MTD only These columns are output only if the target dose for the toxicity endpoint is a single MTD, rather than the dose most likely to have a toxicity rate in the target toxicity band.</p>
<p>If 2 groups are being simulated, then there are two separate simulation.csv and cohorts.csv files. The first simulations file “simulations.csv” contains the results for the first group, the second file “simulations2.csv” contains the result for the second group.</p>
<p>For the cohorts files if two groups are being simulated, the files names ‘cohortsNNN.csv’ contain the results for the first group, and the files ‘named cohorts2_NNN.csv’ contain the results for the second group</p>
