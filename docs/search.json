    "text": "2.2 FACTS 6.5 Changes to N-CRM\nIn FACTS 6.5.0 there was a new feature added to N-CRM:\n\nIt is now possible to generate a design report – a Word document describing design - once the design has been simulated. In FACTS 6.5.0 there was two small changes to the functionality:\nWhen deriving toxicity/efficacy priors from quantiles at the lowest and highest doses, the “middle” probability option now refers to the median dose rather than the reference dose and is now optional. When pre-6.5.0 FACTS files are loaded in FACTS 6.5.0, the “middle” probability option will be ignored and replaced by 0.5.\nWhen deriving toxicity/efficacy priors from specific quantiles the specification of at least two dose levels is now required whereas previously the specification of at least three dose levels was required.\n\nIn FACTS 6.5.0 there were some improvements in the simulated behavior:\n\nDesigns which include efficacy, the “Maximum cohorts used to determine MTD” parameter on the Allocation Rule tab is now observed, in FACTS 6.4.0 and earlier it was ignored.\nIn N-CRM designs using open enrollment without accrual pausing, FACTS will now output entries in the cohort file for subjects that have been lost following stopping rules being met.\nIn N-CRM designs using open enrollment, FACTS will no longer prematurely apply stopping conditions when there are still subjects whose outcomes have been observed, but not yet processed.\nIn N-CRM designs using open enrollment, FACTS will now report the selected MTD/MED/OSD and associated state to be the dose where the stopping conditions were first met, unless the MTD has subsequently decreased post stopping rules being met. This is to prevent a dose above the one selected when the stopping conditions were met being reported as the MTD when it is very likely that there is insufficient data on this higher dose to justify its selection. If rather than reporting the MTD at the point when the stopping rules where met, you would like the trial to resume if the dose selected as MTD has changed (and this the stopping rules possibly no longer met), ensure that the ”Pause accrual and wait for completers” option is selected on the “Stopping Criteria” tab. This allows the trial to resume if the recruitment cap has not been met.\nFACTS Command Line mode and FLFLL (FACTS Linux File Loader Lite) now correctly handle the processing of N-CRM designs whose prior was derived using the “Legacy Prior” option.",

    "text": "2.4 FACTS 6.3.0 Changes to N-CRM\nIn FACTS 6.3.0 a number of changes were made to improve facilities in N-CRM, or improve the way existing facilities were implemented. These were:\n\nNew run-in options: the existing run-in scheme is available as “simple run-in”, “custom run-in” allows a specific sequence of doses and number of subjects to test at each dose to be specified, “small cohort pre-escalation” allows a run that uses a smaller cohort size but follows the dose escalation rules and over dose control.\nNew “backfill” options in open enrolment. Backfill allows subjects that become available at a time when they can’t be allocated to the current dose (because the maximum number of subjects without final results have already been allocated to the current dose).\nImproved handling of “maximum subjects without final results” in open enrolment. In earlier versions of FACTS this was a “global” maximum, which led to a suboptimal allocation pattern and overly cautious rejection of subjects that became available. The new model applies a maximum “per dose” so that once the trial has escalated to a new dose strength, any subjects without final results on lower doses do not block allocation to the new dose, in addition it is possible to specify two different maximums – one for when a dose has just been escalated to but has not been “cleared” (typically smaller and more cautious), and one when a dose has been cleared but we continue to allocate to it because it is the target dose (typically larger and more confident). This method is such an improvement that we recommend moving any design using open enrolment to this new version of FACTS.\nImproved Ordinal Toxicity model – the way the likelihood is calculated has been improved – reducing the uncertainty in the model fit. Any design using an ordinal model will need to re-calibrate the prior if you move the design to FACTS 6.3.0. If you have a design already complete, or in execution we recommend you remain using the earlier version of FACTS for that trial.",

This allowed these features to be used in conjunction with N-CRM’s target toxicity band methodology, overdose control and open enrollment features, as well as in conjunction with each other for the first time.\nThe new features are:\n\nFrom CRM (Toxicity) the option to specify that the data is coming from ‘two groups’ and for the toxicity experienced in the two groups to be modelled with a joint model [CRM 2 Sample]. This allows a trial where there are two patient populations (such as adults and children) or where there are two versions of the treatment to be simulated.\nFrom bCRM the option to model a second binary efficacy endpoint [bCRM] and the for dose allocation to proceed in two stages – the first to establish an MTD and the second to establish an MED.\nFrom CRM Ordinal the option for the toxicity endpoint to be modelled not as binary endpoint, but one with different categories of toxicity, and with a joint model applied to the different categories [CRM Ordinal]. The endpoint can be to model either 3 or 4 categories of toxicity:\n\ncategory 1 is “no toxicity”,\ncategory 2 is “mild toxicity”,\ncategory 3 is “toxicity”\ncategory 4 (if included) is “severe toxicity”\n\n\nAll decision making is made in terms of the probability of observing a category 3 (or worse) toxicity.",

    "text": "5.2 FACTS Settings Menu\nThe “Settings” command menu allows the user to do 2 things:\n\nSet various FACTS options to local settings – see below for details.\nReset the options based on the stored configuration file. This file, “config.xml”, will initially be installed during the FACTS installation process and is stored in the Windows “Program Files” folder, in the sub-folder where FACTS get installed.\nChange the stored configuration file. This command allows you to select a new configuration file and have FACTS copy it to the sub-folder within the Windows “Program Files” folder, where FACTS get installed so it becomes the new stored configuration file. This allows IT support to easily disseminate configuration changes.\nEnter a new or changed license key.\n\n\n5.2.1 Set Options\nThe FACTS Options dialog allows the user to:\n\nSet and Test the connection parameters to access a compute grid for running simulations.\nConfigure the version and location of R or R Studio that can be launched from within FACTS\nSelect how gamma distributions are parameterized.\n\n\n5.2.1.1 Grid Configuration\nA grid compute facility for running simulations will only be available if your local IT services have set one up. If they have done so, they\n\nMay have already set the appropriate parameters In the FACTS configuration file included with the FACTS installation files.\nInform you of the parameters to be set manually via this dialog\nSend a new configuration file that can be installed using the “Load Options” menu command.\n\nIf modifying the grid options manually, select the “Options” menu command and enter the values on the “Grid Configuration” tab of the displayed dialog window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Webservice Configuration\n\n\n\nFirst select the type of interface to the grid to be used, this is either:\n\nVia a network shared drive (with a “sweeper script” running on a client machine to transfer jobs to the grid management system and return results from it).\nVia a web service system using a webserver and database to communicate to a grid management system. The IT group supporting the grid should be able to tell you which interface they have implemented, if any. If access to the grid is via a Network Share it is necessary to specify:\nThe location of the network share folder, usually in the form \\&lt;server name&gt;\\&lt;folder name\\&gt;.\nWhether the grid client is running Windows or Linux (so end-of-line characters can be corrected)\nThe listener delay – this is the interval between “looks” when FACTS is waiting for simulation results to be complete\n\nOnce specified it is possible to use the “Test” button to check that the Network Shared folder is accessible and writeable.\nIf access to the grid is via a web service:\n\nThe location of the web service endpoint.\n\nClicking on “Test Configuration” and will cause FACTS will attempt to connect to the FACTS grid controller. The control will show which components of the connection are working.\nSee the FACTS Installation Guide and FACTS Simple Grid Interface Guide for more details of setting up a grid.\n\n\n5.2.1.2 R Configuration\nIn FACTS on the Simulation tab there are two controls that launch R – “Open in R” and “ Design Report” (in FACTS 6.2.0 the latter only available for FACTS Core designs).\nTo enable these to work the user must specify where the R or RStudio executable is installed and (if there is more than one version of R installed) which version of R to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The R Configuration Dialog\n\n\n\nThe dialog allows the user to Add, Edit, Test and Remove links to versions of R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Adding a link to R\n\n\n\nClicking on “Add” opens a normal Windows directory browser window, the user must navigate to the location of an R installation (for example “C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.15.2\\bin”, select the file R.exe, and click “Open”. This adds a new entry on the R configuration dialog.\nClicking on “Edit” operates similarly to “Add” above, except the selected location replaces that currently selected entry on the R configuration dialog rather than adding a new one.\nClicking on “Test” checks whether the currently selected entry on the R configuration dialog is available, if it is not an error dialog is displayed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Example of R Configuration error\n\n\n\nClicking on “Remove” removes the currently selected location on the R configuration dialog.\nThe version of R to use by default is selected by clicking on the ‘Active’ check box of the version to use.\n\n\n5.2.1.3 Gamma Distribution Parameters\nIn FACTS a number of parameters require inverse gamma distributions to be specified as priors for the parameter value. There are two different parameterization of the inverse gamma provided so that the user can select the form they find the most intuitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: The parameterisation of Inverse Gamma Distributions\n\n\n\nThe first form uses parameters that are the mean of the distribution and the equivalent weight in terms of the equivalent number of observations. The second form uses an ‘Alpha’ and ‘Beta’ parameterization that some statisticians are familiar with and will find natural to use.\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Enter a license key\nIf a new license key is required, this command can be used to enter one. There are two ways of entering a new license:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Enter FACTS License Key\n\n\n\nThe key can be entered directly, along with the associated Organization name, or by selecting a supplied license file.",

The commands are:\n\n\n\nTable 3: List of commands in the CRM help menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nUser Guides\nProvides access to documents such as this one, with (mainly) one user guide to each design type within FACTS. Exceptions to this simple structure are:  1. Core Design User Guide: A guide to the options under the ’Design” tab for FACTS Core for all endpoints.  2. Staged Design User Guide: As the staged design allows the design of one FACTS Core stage followed by a second, most of the interface is common to the basic FACTS Core. This guide describes the differences and additional aspects for all endpoints.  3. Dose Escalation User Guide: This covers all the Dose Escalation engines except for N-CRM and 2D-CRM that have their own. It thus covers the 3+3, mTPI, CRM(Toxicity), CRM(Ordinal), CRM(Efficacy) and bCRM engines.\n\n\nTutorials\nProvides access to all the tutorial documents, which describes detailed examples of use of all the engines in FACTS and many of their options. The examples under the File &gt; Examples menu option largely correspond to the different tutorials described here.\n\n\nDesign Specifications\nThese are technical documents that describe the mathematical models implemented in FACTS in detail.\n\n\nExecution Guides\nThe FACTS GUI can be run in command line mode so simulations can be run/re-run from scripts. With the simulation command line flag, and passed a directory rather than a file, FACTS will run simulations for every “.facts” file in that directory – and recurse into any sub-directories and simulate any “.facts” files there too. A full guide to command line mode can be found here. The FACTS simulation engines are also available in “command line executable” form. There are guides here that document their command line parameters and how to use them to analyse a data set – e.g. to perform an interim analysis whilst executing a trial designed with FACTS.\n\n\nFACTS file XML Specs\nThese guides describe the parameters in the “.facts” files, which are text files in XML format. For expert users understanding this format allows them to use scripts to generate versions of an initial “.facts” file with slight variations in the parameters such as stopping thresholds or priors. Modification of “.facts” files outside of FACTS needs to be done with care, errors may render the file unusable by FACTS.\n\n\nVideos\nProvides access to links to the introductory, training and webinar videos that Berry Consultants has recorded and makes available over the internet to FACTS users.\n\n\nView log…\nIf an error has occurred in FACTS, often the FACTS log file can shed light on what is going wrong. The log file is hidden away in some unfashionable and hard to locate Windows folder; this command option provides easy access to it. Allowing you to email facts support with a description of what occurred, attaching a copy of this log file having saved it somewhere convenient such as your desktop.\n\n\nSupport\nLaunch a simple editor for sending an email to our support account: facts@berryconsultants.net\n\n\nAbout\nDisplays a simple “about box” that includes the detailed version number of FACTS.",

    "text": "1 Introduction\nFACTS 7.0.0 is now available for download via App Center. This release marks the addition of two new FACTS design types: Platform Trial Design – Continuous and Platform Trial Design – Dichotomous.\nPlease contact us regarding any questions.\n\n\n2 FACTS Platform Trial Features\nWithin these new Platform Trial design types, FACTS users can now:\n\nSimulate a platform trial, for a continuous/dichotomous endpoint, with various trial level participant and arm constraints. In particular, users can specify a maximum enrollment time, number of participants, successful treatments, participants per arm and concurrent treatments.\nSimulate a platform trial with treatments arriving at different times during the trial.\nSpecify simulated mean arm responses/effects to be a fixed value or sampled from a distribution.\nSimulate participant accrual, responses, and dropout rates as per FACTS Core.\nSpecify a constant proportion of participants allocated to the control arm, or an allocation dependent on the number of treatments currently in the trial, with the option of performing response adaptive randomization.\nAnalyze participant data and estimate mean treatment responses using a Bayesian independent arm model, or frequentist p-values, comparing treatment arms to a common control arm.\nSpecify “Trial Update” information and frequency, at which analyses are performed and allocation ratios may get updated.\nSpecify when to evaluate “Treatment Milestones”, at which decisions are made about treatment outcomes.\nSpecify success/futility criteria that apply to all treatments, or to specific treatments.\nClassify treatments as Good, Mediocre or Unacceptable to get summary statistics such as the proportion of ‘Good’ treatments that are successful/inconclusive/unsuccessful and similarly for the other classifications.\nView granular simulation and summary results of various Platform Trial operating characteristics.\nGenerate a Platform Trial design report outlining the characteristics of the simulated design in a Word document.\n\n\n\n3 FACTS Core and Staged Improvements\n\nIn FACTS Core and Staged designs (except Time-to-Event designs), users can now simulate single arm trials, with options for both Bayesian and Frequentist p-values to be calculated comparing the data on the experimental arm to an objective reference response/response rate specified on the QOI tab.\nFACTS Core and Staged designs (except Time-to-Event designs) will now correctly handle frequentist calculations when a control arm is not present and comparison is performed against an objective reference response/response rate.\np-value calculations have been updated to better accommodate their use at interims, with dropouts and incomplete subjects now handled differently. No incomplete subjects have a final endpoint imputed, but subjects that are known dropouts and have had the opportunity to complete are imputed/ignored according to the “Handle missingness” option for the p-value.\nLOCF behavior has been made consistent. LOCF will impute a participant’s baseline value as their final outcome if a baseline value is observed and no non-baseline visit data is observed.\nFACTS Staged designs will now correctly handle the mirroring of Stage 1 data in Stage 2 for the Dose Response and Longitudinal models.\n\n\n\n4 FACTS Enrichment Design Improvements\n\nIn FACTS Enrichment Time-to-Event designs, FACTS will now correctly apply the user specified alpha levels per group when calculating frequentist output summaries.\nIn FACTS Enrichment Time-to-Event designs, FACTS will now correctly calculate frequentist output when the underlying design has only specified one group.\nIn FACTS Enrichment designs, FACTS will now enforce group caps to be strictly greater than zero.\n\n\n\n5 FACTS Dose Escalation Improvements\n\nOn the Analysis tab, FACTS will now enforce the specification of the cohort number when uploading a subject data file to run an analysis.\nIn 2D-CRM, FACTS will now correctly handle a rare situation in the row-by-row run-in scheme.\nIn 2D-CRM, the engines when run in a Linux environment will have a correctly formatted simulation results output header.\n\n\n\n6 General Improvements\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: FACTS will now consistently handle the “Date” column in a patients file to be in weeks rather than days, making it consistent with the rest of FACTS. “Patients” files generated from FACTS simulations will report the “Date” column as “DateInWeeks” to avoid any ambiguity.\nBREAKING CHANGE: The “Date” column in Deterministic Accrual external data files will need to be manually updated to specify the date in weeks rather than days.\nBREAKING CHANGE: The “Date” column in subject data file provided when running a FACTS Analysis will need to be updated to specify the date in weeks rather than days. If performing FACTS Analysis via the GUI, the FACTS Analysis tab provides a “Convert Date from Days to Weeks” utility that does the conversion.\nThe precision of results output in FACTS will now consistently be up to 6 decimal places for all design types, except for Time-to-Event designs which will display output up to 8 decimal places.\nFACTS will now correctly handle interactions with the latest version of RStudio to date (2023.03.0). This includes the generation of design reports and the importing of FACTS results output to RStudio via the “Open in R” button on the Simulation tab. Note that FACTS will continue to support older version of RStudio.",

    "text": "1 Introduction\nBerry Consultants would like to announce a new maintenance release, FACTS 6.4.1. FACTS 6.4.1 contains the following improvements to the FACTS 6.4.0 version. Please contact us regarding any questions.\n\n\n2 FACTS (Staged) Core Improvements\n\nIn Time-to-Event designs, the sigmoidal, 3-parameter logistic and hierarchical logistic dose response models have been improved to better handle their respective likelihood evaluation. Namely, when the dose response is non-monotone, or the doses are widely separated.\nIn Time-to-Event designs, the prior for the sigmoidal model’s a2 parameter is now properly applied. As a result, estimates for the sigmoidal model’s a1 and a2 parameter have now been corrected.\nIn Time-to-Event designs, the option to model control separately in TTE predictor models is now applied correctly.\nIn Dichotomous designs, selecting the “Log-odds” parametrization of Posterior Probability QOIs will no longer be rejected as invalid if the Delta values for comparison are outside of [-1, 1].\nIn Multiple Endpoint designs with a dichotomous endpoint, Posterior Probability QOIs with the “Log-odds” parametrization will now be computed correctly.\nA very rare bug has been fixed that occurred when an adaptive design was converted back to a fixed design. The simulator would check the now irrelevant details of the interims and crash.\n\n\n\n3 FACTS Dose Escalation Improvements\n\nIn CRM(Efficacy) designs, FACTS files created with FACTS 6.1.0 or older versions will have their “Model control separately” setting correctly migrated over in FACTS 6.4.1 and later versions.\nIn N-CRM designs, the number of beta distribution samples in the specific quantiles prior derivation algorithm has been increased from 1,000 to 10,000.\nIn Dose Escalation designs, Windows and Linux simulation result differences have been resolved.\nIn 2D-CRM dose values of 0 are now allowed with some restrictions:\n\nany combination where the transformed dose strengths of both drugs are very low (or 0) must be excluded from the study and not have any prior toxicities specified as to have occurred on that combination. The model cannot fit toxicity on such combinations.\nif there is a combination where the transformed dose strength of both drugs are 0, the response model must be re-scaled (using the “Asymptotes” option) so the lower bound is not asymptotically 0, but some value slightly above that (such as 0.0001).\n\nIn 2D-CRM the prior graph on the Response Model tab can now show the sampled priors for the individual drugs without the lowest dose being plotted (when a dose 0 or very low dose is included this can compress the plot for all the other doses). The x-axis has also been re-labelled to make it clear the doses are being plotted at the log of their transformed dose values.\nIn N-CRM if using Open Enrolment and Backfill, the “Max Study Allocation for Escalation” was not being respected, this is fixed in FACTS 6.4.1.\n\n\n\n4 FACTS Enrichment Design Improvements\n\nFACTS will no longer error when running multiple scenarios when using external data files.\n\n\n\n5 Framework Improvements\n\nSimulation of FACTS files stored on a shared drive will be handled more robustly in the case of intermittent connectivity to the shared drive.\nRenaming of FACTS analyses on the Analysis tab will now correctly handle the situation when the analysis name has been unchanged.",

    "title": "FACTS 6.3.0 Release Notes",
    "section": "",
    "text": "FACTS 6.3.0 is now available for official release. This version contains significant changes to FACTS N-CRM Open Enrollment to make it more efficient, and adds to FACTS Core and FACTS Staged Designs (Continuous, Dichotomous and Multiple Endpoint) options to model arms that differ in strength along 2 dimensions (for example, but not limited to: dose strength and dosing frequency). Please contact us regarding any questions.\nIn detail the new features in FACTS 6.3.0 are:\n\nIn FACTS Dose Escalation N-CRM the open enrollment option has been improved:\n\nThe limit of the “maximum number of subjects without final results” is now applied per dose not overall. This means that after escalating to a higher dose, allocation is not held up waiting for later subjects on the lower dose to complete. Accrual is faster, fewer subjects are lost. If you are thinking of doing an open enrollment N-CRM design, we strongly recommend you update to FACTS 6.3.0.\nThe user supplies two limits, one used while allocating to an “uncleared” dose, the other used when allocating to a “cleared” dose (and hence allocating to the MTD).\nIf recruiting 2 groups, different maximums can be specified for the second group.\nThere is now an option so that the simulation of Open enrollment only “pauses” when the early stopping criteria are met, allowing enrollment to be re-started if the final follow up data move MTD to a dose where the stopping criteria are not met.\n\nIn FACTS Dose Escalation N-CRM the open enrollment option has a new feature, the option to use “backfill”. Enabling “backfill” allows a subject who would otherwise be lost (because the “maximum number of subjects without final results” is currently met) to be allocated to a lower dose. There are parameters to control the backfill:\n\nseparate trial maximums can be specified for the subjects allocated in escalation or to the MTD, or in backfill.\nlimits on how many subjects can be on a dose for it to be open for backfill.\nlimits on how high the dose must be before it is open for backfill.\nlimits on how close a dose must be to the current dose for it to be open for backfill.\n\nIn FACTS Dose Escalation N-CRM there are now more “run-in” options:\n\nsimple run-in (as in FACTS 6.2.0)\ncustom run-in – where the user precisely specifies the sequence of doses to be tested and the number of subjects to test at each dose.\nsmall cohort pre-escalation – this follows the full escalation rules, including overdose control but with a smaller cohort size – and the same number of cohorts required to clear doses. Like all run-ins, it ends when a toxicity is observed.\n\nIn FACTS Dose Escalation N-CRM the calculation of the likelihood when analyzing an Ordinal Toxicity endpoint has been improved. This means however that a design using Ordinal Toxicity created under FACTS 6.2.0 is likely to behave noticeably differently under FACTS 6.3.0. If the design is well advanced, or in use, you are advised to stay with using FACTS 6.2.0 for that design. If you are just starting out designing an Ordinal Toxicity endpoint N-CRM we recommend upgrading to FACTS 6.3.0.\nFACTS Core and FACTS Staged Designs features a new 2D treatment arm option and associated 2D response models. The 2D options are available for the Continuous, Dichotomous and Multiple Endpoints. The 2D treatment arm option allows:\n\nArms to be defined as a combination of 2 “factors” e.g. dose strength and dosing frequency, or dose strengths of two different agents.\nThe combinations can be analyzed independently, mapped onto a 1D ordering and analyzed with any of the standard 1D dose models, or with one of the three new 2D response models: a 2D NDLM, a 2D continuous factorial model, or a 2D discrete factorial model.\nTarget Quantities of Interest can be defined to be confined to those combinations in a particular row or column (e.g. the calculate the Pr(max) of the once a day doses).\n\nIn FACTS Enrichment Designs the implementation of fitting of the Hierarchical model (options for treatment arms across groups and control arms across group) have been improved. They should converge somewhat faster and at the FACTS default MCMC sample length (2500), will typically be more accurate than before.\n\nThis release addresses some situations in FACTS 6.2.0 that could cause errors. If any of your designs replicate these circumstances, you are recommended to upgrade to FACTS 6.3.0:\n\nIn FACTS 6.2.0 Dose Escalation 3+3, the simulations don’t properly implement the re-escalation rules after de-escalation. This was introduced when we made the significant extensions to N-CRM in FACTS 6.2.0.\nIn FACTS 6.2.0 Dose Escalation N-CRM many “pseudo-patients” parameters are not interpreted correctly.\nIn FACTS 6.2.0 Enrichment Designs with a Continuous endpoint, when using the Linear Regression Longitudinal Model, it fitted incorrectly when informative priors were used.\nIn FACTS 6 Core with a Continuous endpoint and simulating baseline, calculating a p-value QOI, with BOCF for missing data, the BOCF value for missing subjects was being set incorrectly (only a problem if baseline values are very difference from 0).\n\nThe following minor issues in the FACTS GUI were also fixed:\n\nIn FACTS Dose Escalation with N-CRM when specifying an open enrollment design, maximum subjects on MTD for “clearing” a dose and for stopping are meant to be entered in “subjects” but the GUI interpreted the input as “cohorts’ using whatever was the last cohort size in that “.facts” file.\nWhen using the “Ppn Correct Arm” in FACTS Core by marking arms as “should succeed” in the VSR profiles, if variants were not enabled, the variant target QOI arm selection criteria would incorrectly re-set to “Pr(Max)” when re-opening the file.\nWhen using a large external data file, running simulations with lots of packets could cause “out-of-memory” issues. Finally, some enhancements and fixes in the Design Report in FACTS Core have been implemented.",

FACTS 6.2.4 contains the following fixes to the FACTS 6.2.3 version:\nUpdating to 6.2.4 is recommended for those of you wishing to use predictive probabilities in FACTS Core TTE, in combination with a TTE predictor endpoint:\n\nIn FACTS Core with a Time-to-Event end point and a Time-to-Event predictor, the imputations of final event times for subjects with a predictor event but no final event during the estimation of “predictive probability of success at full enrolment” could produce an error in the prior version. There are two rare situations in FACTS 6.2.3 that uncover a bug in the dose escalation simulator and causes it to produce an error:\nIn FACTS Dose Escalation, in the N-CRM with only 3 doses the simulator could produce an error during some dose escalation decisions.\nIn FACTS Dose Escalation CRM (Toxicity) could produce an error when simulating 2 samples. The remaining, minor fixes in FACTS 6.2.4 are:\nIn FACTS N-CRM, the GUI was improved to handle the “Variant” options making is easier to change them once they were set.\nA fix to FACTS Dose Escalation 3+3 (!) – improved to handle the circumstance when the starting dose is not the lowest dose, and the dose assignment de-escalates to below the starting dose and validates the next lower dose.\n\nPlus we improved the labeling of a class of prior parameters:\n\nIn the FACTS GUI labels of parameters for prior with an Inverse-Gamma distribution the wording has been changed from “mean value” (which is technically incorrect) to “central value”.",

    "text": "FACTS 6.1.6 is a maintenance release for FACTS 6.1.0. The first product release of FACTS 6.1.0 was FACTS 6.1.3. Subsequent releases have introduced the following changes:\n\nFACTS 6.1.4: This was FACTS 6.1.3 with some additional logging when using the grid interface.\nFACTS 6.1.5: This was FACTS 6.1.4 with the Dose Escalation N-CRM re-compiled to allow a higher number (40) of dose strengths to be defined when using “Explicit Doses” rather than finely spaced doses.\nFACTS 6.1.6: This was FACTS 6.1.5 with 2 problems fixed in FACTS Core with a TTE endpoint & FACTS Staged Design with a TTE endpoint. In either engine the calculation of a “Current Trial Predictive Probability of Success at Current Enrollment” had 2 problems:\n\nThere was an error in the way timings of future events were simulated in the calculation of the predictive probability. The result was approximately correct, and erred on the conservative side, the error is more manifest if the trial has long follow-up times.\nThere was an error if the design also includes a predictor endpoint. This effects a much smaller set of designs, but the effect was much more marked and its impact was difficult to characterize in general. Our current advice is to not use predictive probability QOIs in combination with a “Predictor” endpoint using FACTS prior to FACTS 6.1.6.\n\n\nUpgrading FACTS 6.1.6 should introduce no changes to the simulation or analysis results relative to FACTS 6.1.3 except in designs using a time-to-event endpoint and a “Predictive Probability of Success in the Current Trial at Current Enrollment” Quantity of Interest.",

    "text": "1 Introducing FACTS 6.0.0\nBerry Consultants is delighted to announce that FACTS 6.0.0 is ready for release!\nBuilding on FACTS 5, FACTS 6.0.0 adds a new simulation type: “FACTS Staged Design”.\n\nFACTS “Staged Design” is a simulator that runs a “FACTS Core” simulation followed by a second “FACTS Core” simulation that can take decisions based on the result of the first simulation and include data from the first simulation. This allows, for example, the simulation of a Phase II trial followed by a Phase III trial, whether as separate trials or as a seamless Phase II/III.\nFACTS Enrichment Designs includes the flexibility over the timing of interims and the ability to set different decision thresholds at different interims.\n\nFACTS 6.0.0 is fully backwards compatible with FACTS 5 – it can load and run all your FACTS 5 designs – and then add new FACTS 6.0.0 features to them. In particular you can load a FACTS Core design into FACTS Staged Design as the starting point for the design of the first stage. You can have FACTS 5 and FACTS 6.0.0 installed on the same machine, so it’s easy to have a transition period as you move to the new version.\n\n\n2 Key New Features\n\nFACTS Staged Design:\n\nThe simulation of one treatment selection stage followed by another.\nThe stages can be connected on a scale from completely seamless to completely independent.\nFACTS Staged Design can be used to simulate:\n\na Phase II and the consequential Phase III trials, or a seamless Phase II/III trial\na Phase IIA and the consequential Phase IIB trials, or a seamless Phase IIA/B trial\na Phase II trial with a treatment arm selection and expansion stage\n\nThe simulations include:\n\nDifferent options for specifying the interval between the stages\nDifferent options for which data from the first stage can be included in the second stage: all of it, none of it, all the data on the arms retained in the second stage, all the data on the study drug arms in the first stage pooled on the one study drug arm retained in the second stage and just subjects from the first stage who did not complete in that stage.\nRules for selecting which treatment arms are kept in the second stage or are dropped after the first stage, including rules on specific arms (such as “retain the top dose if …”), rules on specific target arms (such as “retain the Minimum Efficacious Dose which has a Hazard Ratio of X or less compared to the Control Arm”) rules across all arms (such as “retain the 2 treatment arms with the highest probability of having a response greater than control, as long as their probability of toxicity is less than …”) and rules applied to groups of treatment arms (such as “retain the two arms that are once a day treatments rather than the two that are twice a day treatments if …”).\nDifferent analysis models, allocation rules, interims and decision criteria for each stage.\n\nThe ability to take decision in Stage 1 based on the predictive probability of the outcome of stage 2.\nThe full simulation output of both stages.\nGraphs of the Stage 1, Stage 2, Dose Selection and Overall results.\n\nFACTS Enrichment Designs:\n\nAs in FACTS Core, the scheduling of interims can now be specified by the number of subjects who have completed or have completed up to a particular visit.\nThe decision criteria thresholds can be specified separately for different interims.\n\nFACTS Core:\n\nThe option to specify a deterministic accrual and/or deterministic allocation sequence, for example allowing custom dose escalation trials with cohort accrual, while allowing the full functionality of the Core engine\n\nFACTS Dose Escalation:\n\nIs unchanged.\n\n\n\n\n3 Downloading FACTS 6.0.0\nThe FACTS 6.0.0 release is available for download from the Berry Consultants FACTS 6 ftp repository at http://berry1.berryconsultants.com/facts_6/.\nLogin using:\n\nUsername: facts_6\nPassword: DynIrgyur4\n\nThere are, as usual, 4 files to download: Documents.zip, Examples.zip, Setup.msi, setup.exe. Obfuscated versions of setup.exe and Setup.msi have been included for those of you accessing through firewalls that prevent the download of .exe and .msi files. Having downloaded setup.e_e and Setup.m_i simply rename the file suffix before using.\n\n\n4 Installing FACTS 6.0.0\nAs with previous version of FACTS, FACTS 6.0.0 installs on a PC. Simply place the downloaded files on the PC / laptop it is to be installed on and run the file “setup.exe”. You will need a new FACTS license key for this new version. It will be sent to you separately.\nFor any support questions or issues, please contact us.",

    "section": "3.2 Computation Requirements",
    "text": "3.2 Computation Requirements\nFACTS relies on running simulations and these simulations can be very computationally intensive. When running simulations, each simulation can be run separately (they do not depend on the results of other simulations) though to do so can be somewhat inefficient – repeatedly starting new processes and generating separate output files for every simulation that will need to be gathered together in a single “simulations.csv” file and then summarized. Thus FACTS allows the user to specify a “packet size” and the total number of simulations for each scenario to be simulated is divided by this packet size to create a set of independent jobs.\nIf the simulations are run on the users laptop or PC, FACTS will spawn a simulation thread for every core on the local machine up to the maximum number of simulation ‘packets’ that have been requested. The simulations are run at reduced priority so it is possible to continue to use the machine e.g. for email or Word whilst they run. Thus usually 2 or 4 sets of simulations are run in parallel depending on the processor in the laptop or PC.\nThere are a number of options for speeding up the running of FACTS simulations:\n\nThe simplest technically (and the approach we used to take at Berry Consultants) is to have a large multi-core server (say 32 core) remotely accessible to FACTS users and FACTs installed on it. To use, the user copies the “.facts” files to be simulated to a network shared directory which can be accessed from the server. Then after remotely logging into to the server, the user copies these files to a drive on the server, runs the simulations, zips up the results (within the FACTS GUI there is the FACTS File &gt; Export Project menu command to do this) and copies them back to the network shared drive and thence to their local machine.\nUse the FACTS network share folder “grid” interface, implemented using file transfers to and from a shared network drive. On a machine that can act as a client to a grid of compute nodes managed by one of the standard grid management packages (they used to be called “SunGrid” and “Condor” but have metamorphosed over the years) a “sweeper script” runs that transfers jobs to the grid. The jobs automatically transfer their results back to this shared drive. FACTS copies the job to a unique subfolder on the shared network location and then watches for a change in the lock file name - “submitted”, “running”, “complete” that are managed by the sweeper script. Once the simulations are complete FACTS copies the results back to the local machine. The fact that the simulations have been submitted to the grid are stored in the “.facts” file. Whenever that “.facts” file is open in FACTS, FACTS will poll the remote network drive to check if the simulations are complete.\nA more sophisticated FACTS grid interface that uses a web services to communicate between the FACTS client and a Linux server running a web-server (Apache Tomcat) and database (MySQL). The web service is used to submit jobs and they are stored in the database. A database process then submits them to the grid, once again managed by one of the standard grid management packages. The simulation results are then stored in the database for FACTS to download once complete. This provides a more robust and manageable interface, but it more work to set up. We can provide documentation and scripts and we can assist in setting this up. This is the form of grid that we now use in-house at Berry Consultants.\nTechnically as 3. (but for a fee) Berry Consultants can set and manage the grid for you in the cloud. Please contact us to discuss your requirements and for pricing. Therefore FACTS is able to offload the simulations from the desktop to be run by an external system. The interface describing the interactions with the external system is described in the FACTS Grid Interface document. With a FACTS Enterprise License, the command line executable files to run simulations externally under either Windows or Linux environments are available upon request.",

Installation will take only a few moments. - Ensure that all the files have the correct file extension and are located on a local drive on the machine on which FACTS is to be installed. Windows can treat installs from networked drives as less trustworthy than installs from local drives and this can result in an incomplete installation. - Right click the setup.exe Windows installation program and select “Run as Administrator”. - Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation. - During FACTS installation you will have to option to enable FACTS to report Analytics back to the App Center. This allows to see how much FACTS is used and which features in FACTS are being used. It does NOT include any user or license information, we can’t see WHO is doing what, only WHAT is being done. Obviously we’d be grateful if you’d enable them. Analytics are off by default they will only be enabled of you enable them. Once installed analytics can be turned on or off from the FACTS “Settings” menu command.",

    "text": "1 Introducing FACTS 6.1.0\nBerry Consultants is delighted to announce that FACTS 6.1.0 is ready for release! Building on FACTS 6.0.0, FACTS 6.1.0 adds two new Dose Escalation simulation types: “FACTS 2D-CRM” and “FACTS mTPI”:\n\nFACTS “2D-CRM” is a simulator that runs simulations of dose escalation trials testing combinations of doses from 2 drugs. The implementation follows that of the 2D-CRM prototype that was available earlier this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFACTS mTPI is an implementation of Yuan Ji’s “Modified toxicity probability interval method for dose-finding trials”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFACTS 6.1.0 also adds a major piece of simulation functionality across (almost) all FACTS engines: ‘Design Variants’, these allow you to have within one “.facts” file, multiple designs with different maximum sample sizes. This makes it much easier to estimate the required sample size for a design. The feature includes the ability to mark specific treatment arms or groups as ‘correct choices’, and FACTS now summarizes not only the proportions of successful and unsuccessful trials, but also proportions of successful trials that also made correct choices.\n\n\n\n\n\nFACTS 6.1.0 is fully backwards compatible with FACTS 6.0.0 and 5 – it can load and run all your FACTS 6.0.0 and FACTS 5 designs – and then use new FACTS 6.1.0 features with those designs. You can have FACTS 6.1.0 and FACTS 6.0.0 installed on the same machine, so it’s easy to have a transition period as you move to the new version.\n\n\n2 Key New Features\n\nFACTS Dose Escalation:\n\nDesign Variants in N-CRM.\n2D-CRM\nmTPI\n\nFACTS Enrichment Designs:\n\nDesign Variants\nThe ability to extend hierarchical modeling with clustered model.\n\nFACTS Core:\n\nDesign Variants\nBetter control over which frequentist calculations are performed.\nThe ability to use p-value QOIs for early success/futility decision making.\n\nFACTS Staged Design:\n\nDesign Variants\nThere is now an ‘Analysis’ tab in Staged Design.\n\n\n\n\n3 Downloading FACTS 6.1.0\nThe FACTS 6.1.0 release is available for download from the Berry Consultants FACTS 6 ftp repository at http://berry1.berryconsultants.com/facts_6/.\nLogin using:\n\nUsername: facts_6\nPassword: DynIrgyur4\n\nThere are, as usual, 4 files to download: Documents.zip, Examples.zip, Setup.msi, setup.exe. Obfuscated versions of setup.exe and Setup.msi have been included for those of you accessing through firewalls that prevent the download of .exe and .msi files. Having downloaded setup.e_e and Setup.m_i simply rename the file suffix before using.\n\n\n4 Installing FACTS 6.1.0\nAs with previous version of FACTS, FACTS 6.1.0 installs on a PC. Simply place the downloaded files on the PC / laptop it is to be installed on and run the file “setup.exe”. You will need a new FACTS license key for this new version. It will be sent to you separately.\nFor any support questions or issues, please contact us.",

    "text": "1 Introducing FACTS 6.2.0\nBerry Consultants is delighted to announce that FACTS 6.2.0 is ready for release!\nBuilding on FACTS 6.1.0, FACTS 6.2.0 adds new features to “FACTS N-CRM”, the ability to generate a “Design Report” from FACTS Core designs and extending the ability to compute predictive probabilities to FACTS Core TTE and FACTS Staged TTE.\n\nFACTS N-CRM extensions. FACTS has had versions of the CRM with an efficacy endpoint, ordinal toxicity endpoint and 2 groups since its inception. But these were in separate engines and used the old CRM model for analysis. We have now added all these features as options to the N-CRM so they can be used with the 2 parameter Bayesian Logistic Regression model, targeting toxicity bands and the option to use overdose control. These features cannot only now but used with this better methodology, but can be used in combination with each other, and in combination with the other advanced features that were already included in the FACTS DE N-CRM simulator such as, run ins, stopping rules, escalation rules, fine grain dosing and open enrollment.\n\n\n\n\nNew N-CRM Graph\n\n\n\nFACTS Design Report. In FACTS Core there is now the ability to generate a “Design Report” as a MS Word file that describes the design and simulation results. The file is not intended as the final article but as something where the bulk of the straightforward text (and equations) have been provided and should just require polishing, particularly with the details of the indication and trial setting that FACTS is inevitably unaware of.\n\n\n\n\nNew Design Report\n\n\n\nFACTS 6.2 completes the implementation of predictive probabilities. Predictive probabilities in the current trial with a TTE endpoint are considerably more complex than predictive probabilities in the other endpoints. For the other endpoints the expected about of information after full enrollment and full follow-up is known, for time-to-event it can depend on multiple things such as accrual rate and the expected number of events so a degree of simulation within the simulation is required.\n\nFACTS 6.2.0 is fully backwards compatible with FACTS 6.1.0, 6.0.0 and 5 – it can load and run all your FACTS 6.0.0 and FACTS 5 designs – and then use new FACTS 6.2.0 features with those designs.

    "title": "FACTS 6.4.0 Release Notes",
    "section": "",
    "text": "FACTS 6.4.0 is now available for official release. Please contact us regarding any questions.\nThe key features of this release are:\n\nThree new dose response models in FACTS (Staged) Core designs.\nAlternative parametrizations to Posterior Probability Quantities of Interest (QOIs) in FACTS (Staged) Core Dichotomous and Time-to-Event designs.\nThe ability to run FACTS from R and to run FACTS in command-line mode on Linux (Enterprise licensees only).\n\nIn detail the new features in FACTS 6.4.0 are:\n\nThree new dose response models have been added across all FACTS (Staged) Core designs. These new options will appear in the model selection dropdown on the Dose Response tab. The new models are as follows:\n\nThe Simple Hierarchical model – a model in which the mean responses for each of the arms in the design are drawn from a normal distribution, whose mean and variance are estimated by FACTS. The control arm can be included in the hierarchical model, or modeled separately, in which case it has its own prior mean and variance. The control arm cannot be included in this model for Time-to-Event designs.\nThe Simple Linear model – a linear model which assumes that the mean responses for each of the arms in the design are linear functions of the associated arm strength. In particular, the arm with the largest mean response is guaranteed to be either the largest dose or the smallest arm in this model. Note that the “2-Parameter Logistic” model in FACTS (Staged) Core Dichotomous designs has been replaced by the “Simple Linear model”. FACTS (Staged) Core Dichotomous designs making use of the 2-Parameter Logistic model will be automatically migrated to the Simple Linear model.\nThe Simple Hierarchical Linear model – a model which uses a linear model as a base dose-response structure but allows deviations from linearity in a manner similar to the Hierarchical Logistic dose response model. Given appropriate priors, if the data and prior distributions are consistent with linearity, the hierarchical variance parameter will be estimated to be small and the model fit will be essentially linear, but if the data is non-linear the variance parameter will be large allowing a significantly non-linear model fit.\n\nIn FACTS (Staged) Core Dichotomous and TTE designs, Posterior Probability QOIs with alternative parametrizations can be set when creating a new QOI. This can be achieved by selecting the appropriate option in the “Compare” dropdown of the QOI dialog. The options are as follows:\n\nFor FACTS (Staged) Core Dichotomous designs, Posterior Probability QOIs comparing the log-odds ratio of the response rate for each arm against that of a given arm can now be created. Previously, only the response rates could be compared.\nFor FACTS (Staged) Core TTE designs, Posterior Probability QOIs comparing the hazard rates of the response for each arm against that of a given arm can now be created. Previously, only the hazard ratios (HR) could be compared.\n\nEnterprise FACTS licensees will now be able to access and run FACTS Core and Enrichment Design (ED) analysis models from R via an R wrapper, the output of which is an MCMC file pertaining to the model. This can be used to simulate trials that require posterior quantities that FACTS does not include (e.g., probability that a dose has a treatment effect in a certain range) or simulate trials that make decisions that FACTS does not include (e.g., sample size re-assessment).\nEnterprise FACTS licensees will also now be able to run FACTS in command-line mode on Linux via a separate executable: FACTS Linux File Loader Lite (FLFLL). Mono 6.8.0+ is a pre-requisite for running FLFLL. Executing a valid FACTS design with FLFLL will generate the same results output as its Windows GUI counterpart; in particular, it will generate the simulations, summary, weeks and patients files. FLFLL can be used to automate the simulation of multiple (potentially related) FACTS designs and, more generally, can be used as a key component of a more complex trial design simulation pipeline.\n\nThe following features were also implemented in FACTS 6.4.0:\n\nThe control arm can now be modelled separately in TTE predictor dose response models within FACTS (Staged) Core TTE designs.\nFACTS Core designs will now report the time of the stopping decision of the trial through a new simulations output column named “EarlySuccess Time”.\nFACTS now computes lower and upper frequentist CI bounds, bias and coverage at the simulation level for all design types and summarized them in the associated summary file.\nA command line option for the number of samples per imputation called “samples-per-imputation” has now been added to FACTS when run in command-line mode. This applied to FACTS (Staged) Core and ED designs.\nThe analysis tab now accepts subject files with missing values for intermediate visits (denoted by -9999).\nThe analysis tab in Multiple Endpoint now accepts data files when the design includes visits where none of the endpoints are observed.\nThe “Interim vs Final” Scatter plot graph in the “Across Scenarios” now handles interactive selection of QOI and setting of thresholds, including the use of p-value QOIs.\nThe FACTS installer will now include an option to share basic, anonymous usage and crash data with the FACTS team. This option can also be enabled/disabled by going to Setting &gt; Options &gt; Analytics. Any change in this area will take effect the next time FACTS is loaded. By default, FACTS will NOT collect any usage/crash data. However, we strongly encourage licensees to enable this option to help the FACTS team proactively improve the software in the areas that matter the most. We take our licensee’s data privacy and security very seriously, so do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions about this feature.\nFACTS will now, by default, automatically calculate the simulation parallelization packet size based on the number of requested simulations. A manual parallelization packet size can be set instead by setting the “Parallelization packet size” checkbox on the Simulation tab. In FACTS command-line mode, the packet size is automatically set unless the user explicitly specifies the “-p” flag.\nInformation about the FACTS license, namely its expiry date, is now available in Help &gt; About.\n[Enterprise licensees only] FACTS will automatically retry any actions involving communication with the FACTS HPC server if initial communication fails (e.g., due to an intermittent connectivity). The following FACTS infrastructure changes were performed as a part of our roadmap to modernize FACTS to make use of the latest available tech stack. Please communicate the following information to your IT team as needed:\nFACTS 6.4.0 will now target .NET Framework 4.5.2. Previous versions of FACTS target .NET Framework 4. Future versions of FACTS will target the latest available .NET Framework version.\nFACTS 6.4.0 is now a 64-bit application and will be installed on the target machine’s Program Files area. Previous versions of FACTS were 32-bit applications installed on the target machine’s Program Files (x86) area. This release addresses some situations in FACTS 6.3.0 and older versions that could cause different simulation results. If any of your designs replicate these circumstances, you are recommended to upgrade to FACTS 6.4.0:\nThe “Pause accrual and wait for completers if stopping rules are met” option on the Stopping Criteria tab of FACTS Dose Escalation N-CRM designs making use of open enrollment did not have the correct behavior when the option was unchecked. This is fixed in FACTS 6.4.0.\nThe standard deviation (SD) of the number of subjects having observed a Cat 2 Toxicity in FACTS Dose Escalation N-CRM designs was calculated incorrectly. This is fixed in FACTS 6.4.0.\nFACTS Dose Escalation N-CRM designs simulations results differed between Windows and Linux (including Windows VMs running on top of Linux) when the Toxicity response Rho parameter was non-zero. The Linux results are now consistent with the Windows results in FACTS 6.4.0.\nFACTS (Staged) Core TTE designs with interims triggered by complete predictor data were not respecting any specified minimum information required on the number of predictor completers before an interim can be triggered. This is fixed in FACTS 6.4.0.\nFACTS (Staged) Core TTE designs with interims triggered by complete predictor data an addition interim at “full predictor data” was being simulated even if not asked for. This is fixed in FACTS 6.4.0.\nFACTS (Staged) Core TTE designs with interims in stage 2 by time, after full accrual a circumstance can arise when follow up stops prematurely and an “inconclusive” result declared. This is fixed in FACTS 6.4.0.\nFACTS Staged TTE with a predictor endpoint and stage 1 data included in stage 2, any stage 1 subjects who had not had their predictor observed by the end of stage 1 had their predictor outcome censored rather than observed in stage 2. This is fixed in FACTS 6.4.0. Finally, there are two unique situations and areas identified in FACTS 6.4.0 (and prior versions) that will be continued developed and improved in future releases:\nIn FACTS Staged Design TTE, where the data inclusion is: “included where we have neither observed an event or the predictor and they are on an arm that is kept in stage 2” and stage 2 interim timings are based on “complete predictor data” and “stage 2 and included stage 1 data”, then FACTS is failing to include the included stage 1 subjects in calculating the timings of the interims in stage 2.\nIn FACTS Stage Design TTE where events are censoring for predictor outcomes, this censoring is not taken into account in the timing of interims by “Predictor Complete”. Resulting in the interims being too early.",

    "text": "1 Introduction\nFACTS 6.5.0 is now available for download via App Center. Please contact us regarding any questions.\nFACTS users can now:\n\nSpecify frequentist margins (“deltas”) in the calculation of p-value and predictive probability QOIs for FACTS Core and Staged designs (except Time-to-Event designs).\nCreate designs with interims triggered based on predictor events for FACTS Core and Staged Time-to-Event designs with a Time-to-Event predictor.\nCreate designs where the final event endpoint analysis can be performed without any imputation based on the predictor endpoint for FACTS Core and Staged Time-to-Event designs with a predictor endpoint.\nObserve significant improvements in the mixing of MCMC chains within the Bayesian Augmented Control and Active Comparator (BAC and BAAC respectively) hierarchical models for FACTS Core and Staged and Enrichment designs.\nGenerate design reports for FACTS Core Multiple Endpoint designs, FACTS Enrichment designs (Continuous, Dichotomous and Time-to-Event) and FACTS N-CRM designs.\n\n\n\n2 FACTS Core and Staged Improvements\n\nIn FACTS Core and Staged designs (except Time-to-Event designs), FACTS users can now globally specify a frequentist super-superiority/non-inferiority margin on the Quantities of Interest tab under the Standard Evaluation Variables area, which will be applied to the calculation of all p-value QOIs and “Current Trial” Predictive Probability QOIs. Note that this globally defined margin does not apply to “Future Trial” Predictive Probability QOIs, which can have their own separate margin defined. In addition, users now have the option on the “Frequentist Analysis” tab to use the frequentist super-superiority/non-inferiority margin in the frequentist analysis.\nIn FACTS Core and Staged Time-to-Event designs with a Time-to-Event predictor, users can now specify designs with interims triggered based on the number of predictor events that have been observed. In addition, and independently of how interims are triggered, users can now specify maximum event caps based on either Final events or Predictor events.\nIn FACTS Core and Staged Time-to-Event designs with a predictor endpoint, users can now specify the final endpoint analysis to not depend on any imputation from the predictor endpoint. This can be achieved by selecting the “No imputation” option within the “Imputation on Predictor” panel on the Design &gt; Predictor Model &gt; Relationship to Endpoint tab.\nIn FACTS Core and Staged designs, the mixing of MCMC chains within Bayesian Augmented Control and Active Comparator (BAC and BAAC respectively) hierarchical models has been improved significantly; in particular, when the prior on tau^2 in the hierarchical model is forced to be small.\nFACTS Core Multiple Endpoint now provides the ability to generate a design report once the design has been simulated. As a result, all FACTS Core design types can now generate design reports.\nFACTS Core and Staged designs now correctly display a trial as having stopped for futility if all arms have been dropped.\nFACTS Core and Staged designs now correctly prevent interims from being performed beyond full enrollment when the “Discontinue interim analysis beyond full enrolment” setting on the Interims tab is selected.\nFACTS Staged Time-to-Event designs now correctly handle interim timings in Stage 2 for the various data inclusion rules as specified on the Data Inclusion tab, and interim information based on “Just Stage 2 data” or “Stage 2 and included Stage 1 data”, as specified on the Stage 2 Interims tab.\nFACTS Staged Time-to-Event designs now correctly handles interim timings based on complete predictor data, when a predictor is included in the design and the “Primary endpoint is censoring for intermediate predictor” setting is selected.\nFACTS Core and Staged Time-to-Event designs now correctly handle predictor based imputation when using a dichotomous predictor endpoint.\nOn the Analysis tab in FACTS Core and Staged Time-to-Event designs, current trial predictive probabilities that estimate an accrual rate no longer require input data to be sorted by accrual time.\nFACTS Core Multiple Endpoint and FACTS Staged Dichotomous designs will now correctly output p-value trend test QOIs as a single output column, rather than one output column per dose, in summary files.\nFACTS Staged Multiple Endpoint designs will now correctly display the endpoint number when outputting p-value trend test QOIs in summary files.\nFACTS (Staged) Multiple Endpoint designs will now correctly display the posterior probability QOI comparison options (“Rates” and “Log-odds”) for dichotomous endpoints. Changing the endpoint from being dichotomous to continuous will delete posterior probability QOIs using the “Log-odds” comparison.\nFACTS Core and Staged Multiple Endpoint analyses will now correctly handle endpoints with visits schedules. Namely, when an endpoint contains only one visit schedule or when an endpoint’s visit schedule involved non-consecutive visits.\nFACTS Core and Staged Multiple Endpoint analyses will now correctly handle endpoints whose visit schedule contains missing data.\n\n\n\n3 FACTS Enrichment Design Improvements\n\nFACTS Enrichment designs (Continuous, Dichotomous and Time-to-Event) now provide the ability to generate design reports once the designs have been simulated. As a result, all FACTS Enrichment design types can now generate design reports.\nThe mixing of MCMC chains within Bayesian Augmented Control (BAC) hierarchical model has been improved significantly; in particular, when the prior on tau^2 in the hierarchical model is forced to be small.\nThe clustering in Enrichment designs has been improved for situations when the prior on tau^2 is chosen to be small (e.g. 0.01 with weight 1).\nThe patients file output from simulations (patients.csv) now correctly populates the dropout state of patients, and can now be used as subject data input on the Analysis tab without requiring modification.\nMCMC Trace plots are now available for all Enrichment design types when viewing simulation results graphs and when performing analyses. To view these graphs, at least one MCMC file needs to be generated. This can be done by going to the Simulations tab &gt; MCMC Settings.\nExternal data file validation has been improved.\n\n\n\n4 FACTS Dose Escalation Improvements\n\nN-CRM now provides the ability to generate design reports once the design has been simulated.\nIn N-CRM designs which include efficacy, the “Maximum cohorts used to determine MTD” setting on the Allocation Rule tab is now observed correctly.\nIn N-CRM designs, when deriving toxicity/efficacy priors from quantiles at the lowest and highest doses, the “middle” probability option now refers to the median dose rather than the reference dose and is now optional. When pre-6.5 FACTS files are loaded in FACTS 6.5, the “middle” probability option will be ignored and replaced by 0.5.\nIn N-CRM designs, the specification of at least two dose levels is now required when deriving toxicity/efficacy priors from specific quantiles. Previously, the specification of at least three dose levels was required.\n\nFACTS Command Line mode and FLFLL (FACTS Linux File Loader Lite) now correctly handle the processing of N-CRM designs whose prior was derived using the “Legacy Prior” option.\nIn N-CRM designs using open enrollment without accrual pausing, FACTS will now output entries in the cohort file for subjects that have been lost following stopping rules being met.\nIn N-CRM designs using open enrollment, FACTS will no longer prematurely apply stopping conditions when there are still subjects whose outcomes have been observed, but not yet processed.\nIn N-CRM designs using open enrollment, FACTS will now report the selected MTD/MED/OSD and associated state to be the dose where the stopping conditions were first met, unless the MTD has subsequently decreased post stopping rules being met.\nIn N-CRM designs using open enrollment, dose escalation rules when using fine-grained dosing will behave correctly.\nIn N-CRM designs using open enrollment and two groups, stopping rules and dose escalations rules will now apply to the correct group.\n\n\n\n5 General Improvements\n\nFACTS now targets .NET Framework 4.8, the latest major version of the .NET Framework.\nA new “Simulation Duration” table can be viewed when right-clicking on a simulation design scenario. The Simulation Duration table gives a granular view of simulation start and end times, as well as its total duration.\nSeveral major improvements to FLFLL (enterprise licensees only): in particular, the ability to process specific scenarios of a design, the ability to process all FACTS files contained within a specified directory, and the reporting of design scenario validation errors. See FLFLL documentation for details.\nIn FACTS Command Line mode and FLFLL, a new flag is available to specify the number of MCMC samples to generate for imputation purposes.\nIn FACTS Command Line mode, the ability to generate a design report has been added. This can be achieved by adding the -report flag and the -rpath flag, where the latter is used to specify the path to the R executable.\nFACTS now provides links to FACTS introductory videos hosted on YouTube via the Help menu.\nSimulation engine errors in FACTS are now displayed in the GUI more informatively.\nThe remaining time left on a FACTS license is now displayed correctly on the FACTS splash screen and Help menu.\nFACTS can now output up to 99,999 patients/weeks/frequentist/MCMC files. Previously, this was capped at 9,999 files.\nAll designs supporting design report generation can have their design report generated without having to perform an additional command execution step in RStudio, by selecting a valid R installation under Settings &gt; Options &gt; R Configuration.\nFACTS will now correctly handle the serialization/deserialization of text inputs involving the following characters: “&gt;”, “&lt;”, “&”, “ ’ ” and “\\”.\nWhen viewing FACTS simulation results through the GUI, estimates of responses, effects and hazard ratios (for Time-to-Event designs) will be display more obviously in the results column headers.",

In the analysis part we use the term ‘Model’, see below.\n\n\nModel\nIn the FACTS documentation we try to reserve the term ‘model’ for the statistical models used in the analysis of the trial data (in the ‘design’ section of the FACTS user interface). Where mathematical algorithms are used for other purposes in FACTS (for instance in the generation of the simulated data) we try to use the term ‘method’. We have found that initially it is very easy for users to be confused between these two parts of FACTS and we feel that using distinct terminology may help to reduce this.\n\n\nMTD\nThe dose most likely to be the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) – the dose with the highest Pr(MTD).\n\n\nMTD+\nThe dose most likely to be the MTD+ – the dose with the highest Pr(MTD+).\n\n\nPr(MTD)\nA dose’s probability of being MTD is the probability that it is the dose with the highest probability of having a toxicity rate in the acceptable toxicity band, and (if a threshold has been specified) does not have a probability of excess or unacceptable toxicity above the threshold. This estimate of MTD is constrained to select one of the available doses.\n\n\nPr(MTD+)\nA dose’s probability of being the MTD+ is the probability that it is the dose with the highest probability of having a toxicity rate in the acceptable band, and (if a threshold has been specified) does not have a probability of excess or unacceptable toxicity above the threshold. Unlike Pr(MTD), Pr(MTD+) includes estimating whether a dose below or a dose above the range of those being tested is more likely to have a toxicity in the acceptable band than any of the doses in the range.\n\n\nProfile\nA profile is a specification of one aspect of a scenario. A scenario is made up of one profile of each of the required types for the type of trial being simulated. FACTS allows the user to specify multiple profiles of each type and then presents all the possible combinations of profiles as scenarios that can be used to drive simulations.\n\n\nResponse\nThe change in a subject’s endpoint compared to their baseline state.\n\n\nScenario\nA scenario is the complete specification of the unknown external factors that determine the data observed on the trial and its timing. The exact factors depend on the type of trial being simulated but typically include:  -) the distribution of the final change from base line, or probability of response or rate of events in the different treatment groups  -) the properties of subjects’ early responses and the correlation with their final outcome  -) the rate at which subjects are recruited into the trial  -) the rate at which subjects drop out of the trial.\n\n\nSPEC\nThe Design Engine Specification, describes the system algorithms, and meaning of parameters.\n\n\nResponse\nThe change in a subject’s endpoint compared to their baseline state.\n\n\nSubject\nSomeone recruited onto a clinical trial for the purposes of learning about the properties of a treatment. Depending on the type of trial they might be patients or they might be healthy volunteers.\n\n\nTreatment Arm\nSubjects on entering the study are randomized to different ‘treatment arms’. Subjects randomized to the same arm receive the same treatment and the responses of the subjects in the arm analyzed to determine the expected response to that treatment, allowing the expected responses to the different treatments to be compared.\n\n\nUG\nThe User Guide; describes how to use the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[N-CRM] = (Neuenschwander, Branson, and Gsponer 2008)\n[Backfill] = (Dehbi, O’Quigley, and Iasonos 2021)\n[Open Enrollment] = (Broglio et al. 2015)\n[CRM 2 Sample] = (O’Quigley, Shen, and Gamst 1999)\n[bCRM] = (Braun 2002)\n[CRM Ordinal] = (deMoor et al. 1996)\n\n\n\nSee the following example\nSee Figure 1 for a trial run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Overview of Test",
