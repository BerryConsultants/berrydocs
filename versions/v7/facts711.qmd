# Introduction

# FACTS Core and Staged Improvements

- In Staged designs, conditional power of current stage 2 when no control arm is carried to stage 2 will now be handled correctly.
- In Core and Staged designs, when recruiting subjects deterministically, specifying a deterministic accrual profile without an associated file and saving the associated design will no longer cause FACTS to close unexpectedly.
- In Core and Staged designs, the Virtual Subject longitudinal responses will handle the fraction of final SD per visit correctly when visits are deleted.
